He played Gus the Gorilla on the \"Betty Boop\" radio show, and Max Fleischer decided his raspy voice would work well for the Popeye character Fleischer Studios was planning.  Costello subsequently did the voice for Popeye in the first two dozen or so animated shorts.  The cartoon was a huge success, which apparently went to Costello's head, and he was fired in 1935 for being difficult.  He took his act to Europe, recording several sides as the original voice of Popeye, which were not marketed in the United States to avoid copyright issues.  He returned to the United States with the outbreak of World War II, ultimately falling into obscurity.
