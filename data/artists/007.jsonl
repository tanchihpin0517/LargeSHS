He is well known for giving rock songs a jazz-oriented style, by playing the fretless bass, with a big influence from Jaco Pastorius. He plays an important part in Argentine rock, where in the mid-1970s, he had various appearances with groups like ALAS and Pastoral. He became one of four members of Ser\u00fa Gir\u00e1n in 1978, one of the most musically influential bands that dominated Argentina's rock circuit for the next four years. In 1982, he  joined The Pat Metheny Group as a vocalist, with whom he recorded three Grammy Award-winning albums.
