Bryars wanted to engage the masses with classical music, and sought a way to liberate the form from the pomposity of its audience. His idea was to form an orchestra of the people. Anyone could join, regardless of skill. The orchestra comprised known musicians playing instruments they had no knowledge of, virtuoso players and people who had never played an instrument in their lives. Their oeuvr\u00e9 would encompass the popular classics and rock songs - music that could be played by ear. No sight-reading skills were therefore required. The virtuoso players kept everything vaguely within the realms of what might be called a tune, with the other players reaching for (and missing) notes nearby. The result was a fascinating atonal mess of a noise, one which was considered profound by several of Bryars classical contemporaries. The results of this experiment led to the Portsmouth Sinfonia's records being pitched at the comedy market which earned them a cult following, enough for them to be selling out the Royal Albert Hall by 1974. Although it ceased performing in 1982, the Portsmouth Sinfonia never formally disbanded.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":null,"originals":[],"covers":["588241","572028","588238","588236","572011","572013","240190","588237","572019","572021","588239","588232","588233","572016","572026","572017","572027","572024","588240","572012","572029","572025","572020","572010","572018","572015","572022","588234","572014","572023"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":["174322","178803"],"eps":[],"singles":[],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}

The origins of Newcleus lay in a 1977 Brooklyn DJ collective known as Jam-On Productions, including Ben \"Cozmo D\" Cenac, his cousin Monique Angevin, and her brother Pete (all teenagers and still in high school). Many members - MCs as well as DJs - came and went as the group played block parties all over the borough, and by 1979, the group centered around Cenac, his future wife Yvette \"Lady E\" Cook, Monique Angevin, and her future husband, Bob \"Chilly B\" Crafton. (The foursome named their group Newcleus as a result of the coming together of their families). By this time, Cenac had begun to accumulate a collection of electronic recording equipment, and the quartet recorded a demo tape of material. With several minutes left at the end of the tape, Newcleus recorded a favorite from their block parties, with each member's vocals sped up to resemble the Chipmunks. The track, \"Jam-On's Revenge\" impressed producer Joe Webb more than the other Newcleus material, and it became the group's first single, released in 1983 on Mayhew Records. A huge street success, the track became known unofficially as \"the Wikki-Wikki song\" (after the refrain); when it was re-released later that year on Sunnyview Records, it had become \"Jam on Revenge (The Wikki-Wikki Song)\". The single hit Top 40 on the R&B charts in 1983, and its follow-up, \"Jam on It,\" did well on even the pop charts. \"Computer Age (Push the Button)\" was a more mature single, with accomplished rapping and better synthesizer effects, and it also hit the R&B Top 40. The first Newcleus LP, Jam on Revenge, was a bit of a disappointment, and their second album, Space Is the Place, did even more poorly upon release in 1984. Without a single as noteworthy as \"Jam on Revenge\" or \"Computer Age\", and with the advent of Run-DMC's organic, rock-influenced approach to rap music, Newcleus faded quickly. Though the Cenacs and the Craftons continued to record sporadically until 1989, they didn't hit the R&B charts after 1986.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":null,"originals":["574194"],"covers":[],"sampled_songs":["1557753"],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":["175048"],"eps":[],"singles":[],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"58237","managed_by":null}
