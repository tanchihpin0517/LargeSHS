That career over, she turned her hand to songwriting and penned the two popular tunes \"Boomps-a-Daisy\" and \"Home, Sweet Home Again\", amongst many others. Some time later, Mills returned to the work of cabaret and revues, and it was while she was on her way to entertain the troops during the Second World War that she was involved in a horrific car accident.

After the latter's disbanding, Cave started The Bad Seeds with three Birthday Party members, soon joined by Blixa Bargeld, and Mick Harvey as a band 'anchor man'. The act enjoyed an increasing cult status and had their international break-through with \"Where the Wild Roses Grow\", a vocal duet by Cave and Kylie Minogue. Besides his band work, Cave has been an avid soundtrack composer, partly with Harvey and Bargeld and partly with Warren Ellis.
