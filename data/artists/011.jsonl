Although their physical characteristics are similar to Gonzo's, each of his alien brethren looks unique. Their temperaments, however, are every bit as weird as Gonzo's. Their leader is Ubergonzo. The Alien Gonzos come to Earth to bring Gonzo back to their home planet. When their spaceship lands at Cape Doom, they perform the song \"Celebration\" and ask Gonzo to do a dangerous stunt as a rite of passage. Although Gonzo pases their test, he ultimately decides not to go with them. The Alien Gonzos don't leave empty-handed, though; after K. Edgar Singer's \"comical\" attempt to destroy them, they make him their ambassador to Earth.","member_of":"28974","members":null,"family":null,"originals":[],"covers":["594413"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":[],"eps":[],"singles":[],"performances_also_appear_on":["180907"],"tributes":[],"added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}

Dench made her professional debut in 1957 with the Old Vic Company. Over the following few years, she performed in several of Shakespeare's plays in such roles as Ophelia in Hamlet, Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, and Lady Macbeth in Macbeth. Although most of her work during this period was in theatre, she also branched into film work and won a BAFTA Award as Most Promising Newcomer. She drew strong reviews for her leading role in the musical Cabaret in 1968. Over the next two decades, Dench established herself as one of the most significant British theatre performers, working for the National Theatre Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company. She achieved success in television during this period, in the series A Fine Romance from 1981 until 1984, and in 1992 with a starring role in the romantic comedy series As Time Goes By. Her film appearances were infrequent and included supporting roles in major films such as A Room with a View (1986) supporting Maggie Smith, before she rose to international fame as M in GoldenEye (1995), a role she continued to play in James Bond films until Skyfall (2012). A seven-time Oscar nominee, Dench won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Queen Elizabeth I in Shakespeare in Love and has received nominations for her roles in Mrs Brown (1997), Chocolat (2000), Iris (2001), Mrs Henderson Presents (2005), Notes on a Scandal (2006), and Philomena (2013). She has also received many award nominations for her acting in theatre, film and television; her competitive awards include six British Academy Film Awards, four BAFTA TV Awards, seven Olivier Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, two Golden Globes, and a Tony Award. She has also received the BAFTA Fellowship (2001) and the Special Olivier Award (2004). In June 2011, she received a fellowship from the British Film Institute (BFI).
