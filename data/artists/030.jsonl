With the help of his brother Joseph , Reinhardt changed his method playing, and all of his solos were played with two fingers.  He used his injured fingers thereafter only for playing chords. Included are performances by the band re-formed by Reinhardt about 1940. The original Quintette du Hot Club de France performances are here.
