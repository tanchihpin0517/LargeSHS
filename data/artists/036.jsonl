Initially almost all of the Corona items recorded in Britain were played by musicians from the Savoy Hotel, usually the Savoy Havana Band. After musician Stan Greening (1888-1971) took over at Regal he was responsible for finding musicians for this studio band. His system was simple, he gathered together a group of musicians that were confident sight readers, who he would pay a \u201cretainer\u201d in exchange for regular work for which they received payment in the region of \u00a32-\u00a33 each per recording session. Greening used a regular group of musicians over a period of almost ten years. Some worked with him in theatre orchestras as their regular work, others played in regular dance bands at supper-clubs and West End hotels.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":null,"originals":[],"covers":["918365","236083","236084","1500926","1249798","760827","1251453","1493092","1517716","1517717","864462","918480","864461","1251450","1448681","1517774","1485377","1448682"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":[],"eps":[],"singles":["263373","336948","248930","222788","412480","407831","248931","405698","337298","392706","403510"],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"52961","managed_by":null}

Depending on who you believe, Mazzucchi was either a cynical song thief re-publishing the songs of others, or he was a young, talented composer exploited by his mentor, the already famous Di Capua; Mazzucchi would play him his compositions, if Di Capua liked them he would release them as his own. In 1976 music publishing house Ferdinando Bideri sent an official letter to the Italian rights office (UPLAS), requesting Mazzucchi be recognized as co-author of dozens of songs previously credited to Eduardo Di Capua alone. UPLAS, filing an appeal, opposed the complaint. After a legal battle that had lasted almost three decades, a verdict was finally issued in March 2002 by the Tribunal in Turin, recognizing Alfredo Mazzucchi as co-author of the melody of 23 songs in total. These will remain under his copyright until 2042 (or 70 years after the death of the author).","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":null,"originals":[],"covers":[],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":["116528","114095","27579"],"written_adapted_works":["68364"],"albums":[],"eps":[],"singles":[],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"7","managed_by":"58237"}
