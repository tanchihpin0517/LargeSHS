All of the bandmembers hailed from Surrey County in North Carolina's Blue Ridge Mountains. Their leader was banjo picker Kyle Creed, who was accompanied by fiddler Fred Cockerham and guitarist Paul Sutphin. The other members were guitarist Ronald Collins, fiddler Ernest East, mandolin player Verlin Clifton, and guitarist Roscoe Russell, making this string band considerably larger than traditional bands that featured a guitar, a fiddle, and vocalists. The band's name came from the community where Creed was raised. During the 1930s, the Camp Creek Boys started out playing at local social events ranging from dances to corn shuckings. They then began working on the radio and playing at old-time fiddle conventions. Even then the Camp Creek Boys were interested in preserving their musical heritage and the distinctive sound of string band music; after live radio performances became less common, they focused on performing at conventions and in fiddle contests. Eventually, Creed became a key figure in the revival of his music. During their career, the Camp Creek Boys recorded four albums for the County and Mountain labels. Their best-known songs include \"Fortune,\" \"Cider Mill,\" and the modern bluegrass favorite \"Let Me Fall.\"","member_of":null,"members":["162081","100088"],"family":null,"originals":["975694"],"covers":["975696","975700","975697","975705","975835","975821","1014923","975698","975702","975707","975704","975706","975703","975695","975699","975857","975701"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":["277200","277203"],"eps":[],"singles":[],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}
