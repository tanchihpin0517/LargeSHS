Formed around 1923 the trio originally was Charlie Poole (banjo), his brother-in-law,  Posey Rorer (fiddle), and Clarence Foust (guitar).  In 1924, Norman Woodlieff replaced Foust and in 1926 Roy Harvey replaced Woodlieff. Fiddler Lonnie Austin replaced Rorer in 1928 and then Odell Smith replaced Austin in 1929. Poole typically did the singing and was the bandleader.  The band's last recording session was in September 1930.  Poole died the following year and the band never regrouped. Depending on who was featured on a recording the releases were often styled as one of the member and then the band - e.g. Charlie Poole (or Posey Rorer or Roy Harvey) and The North Carolina Ramblers.  Sometimes just individual members were credited even though they were accompanied by the other members.","member_of":null,"members":["161957","48962","117119","155332"],"family":null,"originals":["1015128","1075564","934817","193448","652605","1034482","1087276","1087263","1076754","1075565","943488","1032628","1044552","1075566","1075385","1075579","1044551","233383","258508","1075618","1488122","1100059","1100057","1075391","353864","1088078"],"covers":["881892","1585893","1100058","603301","1021452","1014025","1041327","150263","514112","603311","459483","1022505","322492","1056023","1015109","1037518","922339","1021813","1045689","1078732","478239","1041329","1104986","1104993","1028576","1078733","1049615","1045681"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":[],"eps":[],"singles":["253769","286628","299886","267439","71478","302153","183344","287909","286357","295537","304779","57280","158137","183347","299840","431237","264456","288188","118314","269532","291613","293197","288000","83957","293449","145201","292582","91008","305760","299888","286627","304778","300457","109591"],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}
