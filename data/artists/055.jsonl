While stationed in the Aleutian Islands, they met Bob Moreau and formed a five piece band, the \"Aleutian Five.\" After their discharge from the army, the Aleutian Five moved to California and recorded for Decca. This group broke up when the Gallions and Moreau joined two other musicians to form the Vel-Tones with Moreau as the featured singer.
