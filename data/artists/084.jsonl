At age 15 he came to the United States with his two brothers and father. Initially he worked in a hotel restaurant as a busboy and not much later as violonist in the hotel band. In 1902, he was hired as violinist with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in New York and then became first viola player, continuing until 1909. Starting in 1916 he was musical director of the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor) with Rosario Bourdon, where he worked with Enrico Caruso and Marian Anderson.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":null,"originals":["1542279","765189"],"covers":[],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":[],"eps":[],"singles":["419137","223849"],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"261","managed_by":null}
