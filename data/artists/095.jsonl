The name was used as early as 1899 for a group that included tenors John Bieling and Jere Mahoney, baritone S. H. Dudley, and bass William F. Hooley. The best-known American Quartet made its first appearance in 1909 for Victor Records and served as an in-house group. The quartet included Bieling and Hooley, along with tenor Billy Murray and baritone Steve Porter. Bieling left the group in 1913 because of throat troubles and was replaced briefly by Robert D. Armour. Armour was succeeded shortly thereafter by John Young. It proved to be a winning combination for Victor and for the Edison company where it was known as the Premier Quartet.","member_of":null,"members":["71053","23141","120609"],"family":null,"originals":["1235212","1253160","1162503","318206","69211","1407760","182362","1450526","1000405","605688","1348681","210507"],"covers":["1234177","328727","696085","761656","1240875","649791","183309","463250","1496599","1250183","1245453","1185517","1357415","1273511","1017436","303850","874677","1336322","1339425","225749","785521","1429278","315092","1346817","260073","1352618","1359894","1359976","340087","1249234","1348688","1544787","463372"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":[],"eps":[],"singles":["362670","333271","206447","312810","146126","195167","406656","387176","248300","91122","337025","337671","335876","108263","321995","28935","68192","107346","284464","342692","287065","100150","184057","314665","103981","222970","334826","27616","251621","359074","356262","380577","228877","67882","393270","283339","362130","222196","363860","364989","365672","365718","184087","130173","67826","336815","359893","341748","328197","146101","316704","407320","419969","76670","383453","111277"],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"9","managed_by":null}

Kim Deal left the band in 2013, reportedly because she didn't want to record new material with the band.","member_of":null,"members":["7067","3294","21402","21401","32618"],"family":null,"originals":["45282","21544","64251","52816","52817","46958","52815","638","44945","846250","76632","45303","52814","64252","91765","45287","45288","64254","45289","45351","45353","44951","76739","44952","363114","45290","44947","45283","44948","64255","43297","44946","64256","16980","91766","91767","64253","44953","45286","52818","44950","846249","28548","91764","44949","41675","12542"],"covers":["25872","79125","4292","26022","1479742","44622","11093","42958","1858","14898","1427247","1573461","44857","20142"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":["31461","8724","17734","16389","17686","401","4792"],"eps":[],"singles":["16918","386576","17737","17735","17587","17736","428069"],"performances_also_appear_on":["401989","10393","1160","2313","6546"],"tributes":["185639","30546","25806","431743","21373","308996","37169","54597","113361","30479","244157","5316"],"added_by":"2","managed_by":null}

Clarke converted to Islam and adopted the name Liaqat Ali Salaam, which he used professionally for only a brief period of time.  He had a brief affair with a young Annie Ross in 1949, resulting in the birth of a son, who was raised by Clarke's family.  In 1956 or 1957, Clarke moved permanently to France, where he led an octet and big band with Francy Boland from 1961 into 1973.","member_of":"39308","members":null,"family":["1729[Spouse (1944-1956; separated in 1948)]"],"originals":["161282","290476","204840","161285","1087575","1216685","161283","1352897","304433","808156"],"covers":["208212","1352898","628139","208210","158169","178536","1100591","306766","178534","1100592","163660","146809","1224689","306771","1224687","260406","1100608","205236","205247","901476","666539","946772","161284","700845","1225300","901471","666541","1224688","702679","1100589","901469","666538","208209","123107","672422","1560286","418119","306770","1100604","1100610","138247","1100590","654533","146810","418120","700844","178535","418118","700847","138245","171753","306767","901472","700842","946761","147027","901473","666540","901474","666536","178533","1097083","654528","110735","420420","158166","702680","702681","158170","1225301","654531","821658","1224686","147025","158172","1100601","158167","672420","1100605","654527","1224684","208213","110733","158168","1225297","483395","1100607","158171","1100603","667100","1087576","483392","1097085","654529","1097088","665437","1100602","1097086","1100606","278585","654532","208211","146811","260408","1097082","901477","652740","901475","110734","1209275","1097084","1100593","138246","147028","654526","194391","1363498","306764","1224690","1087567","306768","946762","483393","420419","672421","334130","740640","483391","204845","1097087","483998","946771","146812","700846","204841","260407","306765","1225299","171754","665436","334132","147026","917772"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":["71901","131085"],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":["302233","56146","74978","75110","199083","327650","407404","104833","238081","196274","331191","56084","64079","76026","195866","60645","44409","59729","200399","112845","198682","66699","136097","53363","304724","304126","331358","91540","270294","150884"],"eps":[],"singles":["363917","48396","261259"],"performances_also_appear_on":["66526","24570"],"tributes":[],"added_by":"23","managed_by":"67302"}
