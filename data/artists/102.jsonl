He became a counselor at the Wiltwyck School, a New York State institution which is famous for the splendid care it gives emotionally disturbed children. He found that the children responded extremely well to folksongs. It was while at Wiltwyck that he was given the important role of the sympathetic counselor in the widely acclaimed documentary film \u201cThe Quiet One\u201c-1948. He left Wiltwyck in 1950 and has since performed widely in person and on radio. He recorded one 10\u201d Album for Elektra in 1955 (\"Goin' Down the Road\" EKL 27), and performed and recorded as part of The Tarriers (1958-1964). He appeared on several of their albums, and also served as an arranger on their records. After he recorded 2 albums with The Wanderin' Five in 1963, the next year he was sidelined with a congenital heart problem, which he had surgery to correct. One of his songs, \"So Glad I'm Here,\" was recorded by Carly Simon and Lucy Simon, working as the Simon Sisters.","member_of":"52829","members":null,"family":null,"originals":[],"covers":["101493","769238","769241","769240","1170667","769239","283636","101492","769237"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":["41408"],"eps":[],"singles":["98136"],"performances_also_appear_on":["318569"],"tributes":[],"added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}
