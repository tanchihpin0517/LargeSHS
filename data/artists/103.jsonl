The original Asia broke up in 1986, reuniting (but not all the original members) in 1989.  In 1991, vocalist\/bassist John Payne joined Geoff Downes in recruiting new members for Asia and, Payne and Downes led Asia until 2005.  In 2006, Downes decided to rejoin the original members of Asia and to tour under this name.  A dispute over the use of the name \"Asia\" was resolved when an agreement was reached that allowed Payne to use the name \"Asia Featuring John Payne\".

His paintings have been exhibited in many major museums. Beefheart was also a published poet. Beefheart and Frank Zappa knew each other from their teen years when they developed a friendship over a shared interest in Chicago blues. Over the years, the pair had a love-hate relationship, but collaborated on several occasions. Beefheart was known to be harsh - even cruel - and exploitive of the musicians whom he hired for his band. Band members resented the fact that Beefheart took sole credit for the compositions that were really more collaborations. In his 2010 book, \"Beefheart: Through the Eyes of Magic\", John French recalled in detail his mistreatment by Beefheart, but he nonetheless worked for him on-again, off-again between 1966 and 1980 and remained in contact with Beefheart until the latter's death. Many musical artists have cited Beefheart as an important influence.","member_of":"113694","members":null,"family":["189111[Spouse]"],"originals":["1350670","514002","1178569","427008","401823"],"covers":[],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":["254161","294203","75850","33191","152996","259058","75448","154619","99522","254341","33189","145860","23103","159746","75444","159663","250559","259023","81046","75434","75440","259024","254168","72978","4503","259030","10354","78842","75450","75452","35671","259040","117942","192447","254170","259032","48630","259045","152995","75446","130650","193696","177455","70339","254169","259025","152997","40158","254163","259022","99529","33187","140490","159756","198326","254162","99525","259039","75442","127219","251566","99532","99527","14479","152998","149440","99519","151514","259059","259042","70608"],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":["137975","132221","158108"],"eps":[],"singles":[],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":["327952","320351"],"added_by":"2","managed_by":null}
