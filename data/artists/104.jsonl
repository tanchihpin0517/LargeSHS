He appeared at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1963 and 1965. Because of his support to the \"Croatian Spring\" movement he was politically persecuted. In 1970 his songs and his performing were banned in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Fearing arrest he decided not to return to Yugoslavia after his Australian tour in January 1972. He settled in Paris, France instead. This ban was in force until 1988. He returned to Yugoslavia in 1976, but was forbidden from public performing and traveling. Improved political situation allowed him an attempt with a self-released compilation cassette release in 1986. After the introduction of democracy to Croatia, Vice Vukov became a prominent supporter of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia. He held a seat in the Croatian Parliament from 2003. In November, 2005 Vice Vukov had an accident and head injury, and since that moment on he was in a persistent vegetative state until his death.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":null,"originals":[],"covers":["147816","1099390","147818","700405","1099394","118030","147817","1154697","118029","961628","147821","147815","147820","1154695","148027","974166","147819","1099596","1154696","1310636","1154698","1099398"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":["227964"],"albums":["56382"],"eps":["304622","46774","276833","314983"],"singles":["352560"],"performances_also_appear_on":["273887","207359","56452"],"tributes":[],"added_by":"2841","managed_by":null}
