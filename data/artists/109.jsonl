Their name is US military slang for \"Navy pilots\": their original members were in fact all enlisted in the US Navy. In 1960 Fowlkes met fellow bluejacket, boxer and singer Charlie \"Rocker\" Roberts. Roberts and Fowlkes launched their musical collaboration while they were both stationed in C\u00f4te d'Azur. Their stay in France wasn't particularly rewarding, but when they moved to Italy they scored a string of hits as \"Rocky Roberts & The Airedales\". Meanwhile, the line-up had changed with the inclusion of, among others, bassist Wesley \"Wess\" Johnson, whereas Fowlkes stepped down from being the drummer and bandleader for a more behind-the-scene role as agent, producer and occasionally songwriter. Around 1967 Roberts started working with other backing musicians and Wess took over as lead singer.","member_of":null,"members":["31874","158309","158308"],"family":null,"originals":["1557991","904939","60170","613559"],"covers":["542201","542206","541942","63801","541951","237648","1228244","31632","1060499","895695","542193","412377","1204088","156420","410900","1204091","541941","237649","31631","1204083","1228246","541940","31633","542195","542244","542216","148150","529775","205700","31635","542204","671069","541950","1204082","542214","542196","1204077","542188","1204086","542207","542222","541943","542192","1204093","542242","1204084","542194","1228245","542187","542190","1204069","541953","542191","542203","523545","1204087","410633","187752","31634","542202","542234","1204090","1204092","523544","237647","1204089","541949","1205520","215099","542200","510491","209143","1228247","1205519","542189","412982"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":["160570","326243","165781","259910","165785","257400","326242","134750","326238"],"eps":["165774","165727","165775","165731","165729","85303","165776","165773"],"singles":["69572","134328","69362","56533","69558","423794","200112","134238","69556","24189","186316"],"performances_also_appear_on":["296575"],"tributes":[],"added_by":"2841","managed_by":null}
