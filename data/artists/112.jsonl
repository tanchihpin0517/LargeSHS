When Cole's request for more money was rejected by the white managers of the company, he took his songs and left the outfit, only to have his reputation tainted by the managers claims that Cole was a thief and troublemaker.  This resulted in Cole using the name \"Will Handy\" for his later publishing ventures. At the turn of the century, Cole moved away from writing coon songs, establishing a fruitful partnership with J. Rosamond Johnson, frequently assisted by Johnson's brother, James Weldon Johnson, who, in 1897, became the first black since Reconstruction admitted to the Florida Bar.  Johnson was also an early civil rights activist, pianist and gifted writer.
