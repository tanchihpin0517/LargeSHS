Original members were - Dick Hartman on mandolin and vocals, Harry Blair on guitar and vocals, Kenneth Wolfe on fiddle, and Cecil Campbell on banjo and steel guitar. By the time they made their first recording for Bluebird Records in 1935, they had added bassist Fred \"Happy\" Morris, fiddler Elmer Warren, and a novelty musician named Jack Gillette. The group initially called themselves Dick Hartman's Tennessee Ramblers on all of their 1935 Bluebird recordings. Hartman left in late 1936 and they billed themselves simply as the Tennessee Ramblers (and later as Cecil Campbell's Tennessee Ramblers).  Campbell remained with the band up until the 1980s. NOTE: there is another Tennessee Ramblers [US1] who were an old-time 1920s string band actually from Tennessee.
