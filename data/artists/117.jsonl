She was a major influence on Grandpa Jones with whom she worked at radio station WWVA in the 1930s and where she taught him how to play the banjo. In 1937 she formed her own traveling variety show troupe, \"Cousin Emmy and Her Kinfolks.\" They toured and appeared regularly on radio during the 1930s and 1940s. They were so popular that for fours years they had their own daily show on KMOX, a 50,000 watt station based in St. Louis, Missouri. Although she continued to perform on stage, radio, television and in films during the 1950s, her career peaked in the 1940s. However, there was renewed interest in her when she was \"rediscovered\" by the New Lost City Ramblers in the 1960s. She was married to Johnny (Alfred) Creasy and sometimes referred to as Mae Creasy or Joy May Creasy.
