One of the earliest Italian rock 'n' roll singers, he is nicknamed \"Il molleggiato\" (\"springy\") for his stage moves, inspired by Jerry Lewis . In December 1961 he founded Clan Celentano : not just an independent record label, but (at least in theory) a close-knit circle of like-minded singers, songwriters, musicians, friends and relatives. Thanks to \"The Clan\", he developed a unique style, blending rock 'n' roll, classic pop, cabaret music and topical songs. Throughout the 1970's and 1980's, Celentano starred in (and sometimes directed) a string of successful comedy films, and more recently he has hosted a series of television specials.

Baker was associated with the west coast jazz movement. He became addicted to heroin in the 1950s and struggled with drug problems the remainder of his life, doing time in prison, including over a year in Italy on drug charges.  In 1968, Baker was severely beaten, and his teeth were all broken, causing him to lose the ability to play trumpet.  He ultimately got dentures and eventually developed the ability to play trumpet again. From 1973 until 1982, Baker lived with singer Ruth Young , and from 1978 until his death lived primarily in Europe. He fell from the second story of a hotel in Amsterdam and died from head wounds at the age of 59.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":null,"originals":["735751","1209615","1247798","372386","317487","294075","654345","746153","1101138","1103043","788008","968218","761199","1060524","789525","739216","577298","1053431","1009252"],"covers":["786725","131441","407858","546083","516906","189508","279612","523940","678574","146804","25481","83932","786709","205726","445574","431933","298134","1447069","624742","1069248","1053435","432022","432017","131442","146802","1043127","592251","559796","562214","148116","148834","297386","157505","546087","1209621","1340882","586497","217707","968219","492666","280014","1101129","569677","191126","548166","131443","141726","630318","1209620","87496","316865","321721","1307378","432018","445579","409566","408447","445592","297381","678573","1538839","1101128","431935","666751","1157305","415924","189509","401181","297377","516811","432009","141997","432013","786724","604402","409564","407854","298138","586498","786726","205727","372402","415929","548163","1092550","445590","431925","415921","529794","1576596","1340883","297382","1538834","934445","761648","141998","210212","433481","809604","321729","431936","179341","1346896","736407","323601","884897","297374","1447098","251247","445589","582945","582942","582950","1447054","191396","559799","525095","416934","298140","199339","445583","432016","445575","678570","912925","1587840","491277","445578","321722","297378","542957","1101131","205724","542958","809602","1157302","148117","148836","141994","849674","1455390","83926","321726","678632","126434","445581","1455393","809600","607346","548160","786715","516910","126410","445591","148120","1043123","148835","592250","761204","539232","1053438","529784","599629","284422","141996","321727","761201","432020","319336","298141","516909","529790","83928","141995","189507","786712","1327040","297392","559808","1522535","445576","546092","83910","1327049","569674","225744","562217","319335","630321","592252","189442","189227","407855","321720","1101135","297383","217708","516911","523939","523937","562215","516807","1043687","179334","1327048","602093","539229","407861","968216","1522568","1455389","1538833","809605","1101134","1538843","284417","412947","189228","1425319","126431","761203","157876","542959","1157303","566947","539230","562216","761202","504128","137936","415926","445600","297376","407860","192663","199338","432023","529781","678571","131296","516810","523942","548144","316866","10408","539231","100131","407859","546084","968217","638182","141999","347864","523938","1157704","217709","1053436","148115","539233","148833","775949","445599","1098742","146801","1209617","141992","1101133","150592","586499","321723","205725","761647","1538840","83931","297389","146806","157504","508196","432024","809603","525199","653719","678633","432014","432010","891945","1053441","539693","546091","217705","678631","910342","494039","786717","432019","445580","1447080","241417","761644","83929","985577","1043131","280015","320175","320172","189226","431927","1455388","137933","297390","409565","525096","297380","431928","445593","157506","284419","407857","548164","546090","445597","298143","678572","431926","1098734","554579","244011","456084","297385","116026","148119","148837","1043118","1455392","187139","178020","559802","187138","179032","1043129","786728","297375","83927","131295","415922","445577","1292840","1455391","83930","529793","431931","141991","445598","1538832","297387","415928","148832","1538835","126409","1613754","189441","548142","968220","297388","1043125","157507","415927","298136","146811","248833","279611","569678","189512","678569","1538831","187141","321719","189443","189225","189513","586496","529791","126432","786719","786713","491282","445582","432021","297379","178817","431930","298144","655751","614742","483411","157503","761205","1538836","189510","559807","934442","321725","62672","189511","432015","415925","712977","712979","88787","131444","559804","678568","433483","516809","432012","1053433","548167","297391","611828","1053440","786718","445594","761200","189232","280016","321724","1043130","809601","431939","1455394","141993","659264","445601","415923","963815","878619"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":["178029"],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":["56770","166960","295030","102203","66929","135633","229166","138995","57384","201837","327730","275445","229160","35770","183007","73230","25166","70140","56508","66848","33649","162443","87166","97047","98320","4617","51301","10247","66926","178384","89208","152793","133968","59470","315466","167537","160714","81475","177422","234913","139007","210599","76602","392221","158759","102204","51344","70128","139008","142069","298636","210598","54705","165031","201822","293003","133533","304990","160713","229159","153444","304415","222964","156605","132044","172901","142074","86436","192578","40905","392242","109902","180026","158742","171563","196232","53248","167534","394
