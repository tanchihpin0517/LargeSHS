The original four members were John \"Tennessee\" Smith (tenor), his brother A.L. \"Smitty\" Smith (lead), Milton \"Ace\" Richman (bass), and Pat Patterson (baritone). Patterson was replaced by Eddie Wallace in 1942.  Wallace had a gospel background so they added that to their reportoire. They would perform on the radio as two personas - a Western Swing band called \"Light Crust Doughboys\", and a gospel act called \"Sunshine Boys\".  In 1945 they moved to California and began appearing in Western movies as the Sunshine Boys. In the latter 1940s they recorded a number of gospel songs and the band membership changed as some wanted to stay with the C&W style so they departed.  Henceforth, gospel was the band's main reportoire. In the 1950s they signed with Decca and would be asked to record with other artists, with their biggest success backing Red Foley on his \"Peace in the Valley\" single.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":null,"originals":["382931"],"covers":["131725","618724","1477247","280832","618725","1521235","101420","397472"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":["187702","131062"],"eps":[],"singles":["51461","413489","97387","41375","127086"],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"6487","managed_by":null}
