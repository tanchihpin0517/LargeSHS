Its castle, built in 1277 as part of the \"Iron Ring\" of castles installed by King Edward I of England to suppress the Welsh and occupied by Marcher Lords, was largely dismantled (\"slighted\") in 1646 by Cromwell's forces during the English civil war.  A replacement building was built within the medi\u00e6val stone ruins in 1826.  In the early 1960s, the modern castle was converted into a hotel.  The hotel is a popular stopover location for whistle-stop tours of the United Kingdom and caters for coach parties of visitors, with one of its attractions being a medi\u00e6val-style banquet presided over by 'the Baron' and his court in period costume.  Musical entertainment is provided by 'Ladies of the Court', primarily consisting of traditional folk singing and harp playing.  Souvenir albums of the musical programme have been recorded for sale to guests.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":null,"originals":[],"covers":["286198","416330","286197","441034","286199","286203","416331","286200","416329","286196","416328","286202","286201"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":["135718","98792"],"eps":[],"singles":[],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"4544","managed_by":null}
