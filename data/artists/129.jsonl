Bridges sang lead, accompanied by Leo \"Lot\" Key, tenor, Dave Ausbrooks, baritone, and Ed Sherrill. The group became Alabama's first professional quartet when in 1926 they were discovered by a Columbia Records talent scout, and travelled from Jefferson County to record in Atlanta. They achieved nationwide popularity through their live radio broadcasts over WAPI, WVRC and WJLD. Becoming one of Columbia's most prolific black vocal groups, they played vaudeville stages in New York and Chicago with the likes of Ethel Waters. They played a mix of both gospel songs and secular material, performing on gospel and vaudeville stages alike. The group disbanded in the 1930s when Dave Ausbrooks died.

Cummings was from a prominent family in Joplin, Missouri.  His godfather was Orville Wright, who, when Cummings was still in high school, taught him how to fly.  When the U.S. government began licensing flight instructors, he became the first officially licensed flight instructor.  Cummings studied aeronautical engineering for a year at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, but dropped out for financial reasons after his family suffered substantial losses in the 1929 stock market crash. Cummings studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City because it paid its male actors $14 a week.  He initially appeared on Broadway, acting under pseudonyms (as he did in his early film career), but by the end of the 1930s, he was acting under his given name.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":["77030[Second of Five Wives (1933-1945)]"],"originals":["303199","1042430"],"covers":[],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":[],"eps":[],"singles":[],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

Sondheim has also written music for film. Sondheim had a hard childhood, and he came to hate his mother, whose funeral he famously refused to attend.  After his parents' divorce when he was nine, Sondheim was sent to live on a farm in Pennsylvania, where he became friend's with James Hammerstein, the father of Oscar Hammerstein II , who became something of a surrogate father, as well as a musical mentor to Sondheim. Sondheim came out as gay in the 1980s; however, he is essentially an introverted and solitary person who has felt like an outsider since his youth. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1975.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":null,"originals":["804754","499195","1228809","804753"],"covers":["436692","436691","498602","462655","436688","436687","1556301","436693","1556300","943848","804767","695638"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":["258615","115013","158997","155564","258862","198506","272446","29773","153686","225195","127010","270568","258617","243419","158079","259145","158059","130654","186347","270576","151669","225193","158057","197329","152464","236468","204346","127063","288539","139240","153687","270577","272385","157896","145614","177406","127058","259570","204342","112527","288812","127093","288790","261377","110129","178017","155052","154112","151823","157528","270573","288764","288809","156063","225186","158058","84413","261641","155873","115014","272098","127074","154136","158050","259144","37429","197321","272891","288765","223448","155569","153761","139243","127079","288792","122871","162335","156066","272441","223453","177397","96812","139766","158105","268766","149193","314899","153699","257721","54461","151931","122872","272888","158078","225668","155877","145615","261374","155503","269078","62828","130632","110695","259568","288544","130601","17818","156029","270580","288763","288789","288810","151930","258608","272443","204344","154866","74067","236465","270582","268778","288541","119443","174167","156031","11387","257758","155574","112522","272335","156027","259060","154152","270117","112533","54460","30246","163034","132787","152465","270119","209712","154140","272440","155838","155567","270579","270121","288766","253028","261376","259502","258859","155828","288814","194206","158106","273044","133326","143623","188791","272437","155575","270565","154192","158060","258861","204325","270115","215639","130834","54466","154113","305535","222849","155501","268772","268777","288791","155566","155878","288543","156028","155876","204323","155576","261375","155570","157526","173207","112547","127076","288811","270578"],"written_adapted_works":["138817","186346","168152","157527"],"albums":["140102","233561"],"eps":[],"singles":[],"performances_also_appear_on":["149215","82853","145967","206338","154360"],"tributes":["82846","163774","373906","82847","203715","359030","82851","82853","203739","119955","145717","410290","327363","272444","192131","151959","82861","233524","119954","90675","291055","242029","186864","146014","349999","145182","90681","153106","235141","145972","348730","148767","148855","82925","221742","324973","352459","389560","357224","286515","82886","228966","228962","192430","82929","154360","255051","82891","324599","228710","389113","146009","365942","142453","357039"],"added_by":"2","managed_by":null}
