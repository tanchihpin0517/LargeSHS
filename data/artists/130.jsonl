With an interest in the Celtic Revival, she visited Eriskay in 1905.  There she witnessed many Gaelic folk songs endangered as a result of population decline and began a project to record and transcribe the music of the Hebrides.  In the following years, she visited many of the islands to the west of Scotland, recording the traditional songs with a wax cylinder phonograph.  She later arranged them for voice and piano, or sometimes for harp or cl\u00e0rsach, publishing four volumes of songs.  For her contributions, she was awarded with a CBE and an honorary degree of Doctor of Music from the University of Edinburgh, to which she presented her archive of songs, including her original wax cylinders of recordings.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":["78889[Sister]"],"originals":[],"covers":["313830"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":["137549","137486","166022"],"albums":[],"eps":[],"singles":["106971"],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"4544","managed_by":null}

His father, Robert Altman, also a movie director, commissioned Johnny Mandel to compose a song for the character Private Seidman in the 1970 movie M*A*S*H, stipulating that it should be called \"Suicide Is Painless\" and that it had to be the \"stupidest song ever written\".  Robert Altman tried writing a lyric himself but couldn't write \"anything nearly as stupid as what we need\" and gave the task to Mike, then aged 14.  Mike wrote the words \"in five minutes\", to which Mandel later added the melody.  In a 1980s interview, Robert Altman said that while he made $70,000 for directing the movie, Mike had earned more than $1 million in royalties for co-writing the song.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":["103447[Father]"],"originals":[],"covers":[],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":["11955"],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":[],"eps":[],"singles":[],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"2","managed_by":null}
