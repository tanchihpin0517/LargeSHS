While Albers himself never showed public support for the Nazi regime he became the most popular actor under Nazi rule. The actor nevertheless avoided an overly close association in public. As the ultimate sign of his popularity, the Nazis even silently accepted his relationship with Hansi Burg for a long time, who went to Switzerland and then to Great Britain in 1939, but they secretly remained a couple with him even managing to send her financial support.
