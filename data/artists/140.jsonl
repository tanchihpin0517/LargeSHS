Davies last film was made in 1937. After establishing a reputation as an actress, she began a romantic relationship with the publisher William Randolph Hearst, with whom she ultimately lived for over 30 years.  Hearst actively promoted Davies' career, but this may have been more of a hindrance than a help.  Hearst and Davies were apparently the parents of Patricia Van Cleve Lake, who became the wife of Arthur Lake.  Davies claimed Patricia as her neice.  A rumor also persists that Hearst accidentally shot Thomas Ince leading to Ince's death.  Ince was a producer, director and actor in silent films.  Supposedly the bullet was intended for Charlie Chaplain, who Hearst believed was having an affair with Davies.  Hearst suffered financial reversals in the late 1930s, and Davies bailed him out by selling some $1 million in jewelry. Davis was civic-minded, and donated substantial sums to charitable causes, including almost $2 million in 1952 to establish a children's medical clinic at UCLA, which since 1998 has been known as the Mattel Children's Hospital, although UCLA's medical center continues to maintain a Marion Davies Clinic. Davies died of stomach cancer.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":null,"originals":["1579121","937100","410976"],"covers":[],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":[],"eps":[],"singles":[],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}
