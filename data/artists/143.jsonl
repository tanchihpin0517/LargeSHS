While an undergraduate, Austin gigged around her hometown of Los Angeles.  Upon graduation, she moved to England for a year  and then Japan for over five years.  Austin returned to the United States and earned a law degree from the Boalt Law School at Berkeley; however, she decided not to take the bar examination but, rather, to devote herself fulltime to music.  Austin is also a lyricist and teaches voice privately at the East Bay Center for the Performing Arts in Richmond, California.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":null,"originals":[],"covers":["450018","450023","450019","450020","450022","450021","450017"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":["143232"],"eps":[],"singles":[],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}
