Reportedly, the original plan was to record an album of songs written by Deal, followed by an album of songs written by Donelly. Kim Deal asked her twin sister Kelley to join The Breeders in 1992; soon after, Donelly left the group to form Belly. Since then, The Breeders have toured and recorded intermittently, undergoing diverse line-up changes, the only stable members being Kim and Kelley Deal.","member_of":null,"members":["7067","27235","25178","42242","148482","22875","153526","153525","153524"],"family":null,"originals":["23339","1194778","47545","70707","1194813","70699","1466211","1325902","70703","1330177","1194779","42568","297632","70701","70700","867937","1466219","118844","1271896","1430996","1194795","70702","1328648","1466208","70708","1325216","18259","70692","1329731","1327849","70705"],"covers":["669312","42581","107794","42579","55984","55982","42567","669315","15359","42563","669314","42562","282515","42565","42560","1271871","712373"],"sampled_songs":["23339","18259"],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":["210474","7480","97868","6364","16780"],"eps":["43433","16778"],"singles":["16775","324144","16776","28144","16774","16788","199680","199681","199682"],"performances_also_appear_on":["342273","16786"],"tributes":["357936","324143","364501"],"added_by":"7","managed_by":"99660"}

He played with the Savoy Orpheans, Bert Firman's Devonshire Restaurant Band and Ambrose, before establishing himself as a bandleader recording prolifically on Decca. Decca's director of music was Philip Lewis, who had a background in light classical music and directing theatre pit orchestras. So far as the new Decca studio group was concerned, Lewis relied heavily on Lally. All the recordings from the first two 1929 sessions (June 20th and 29th) were issued as by \"Philip Lewis and his Dance Orchestra\", but from the third session (July 16th, 1929) onwards the pseudonym \"The Rhythm Maniacs\" started to be used.
