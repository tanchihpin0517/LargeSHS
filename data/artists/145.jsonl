Not even the advent of war in 1939 could lessen the enthusiasms and loyalties of the steel and tinplate workers making up the major part of the Choir. Early in 1948 the Orpheus combined with the Morriston United Choir. The Orpheus began a long series of appearances on the B.B.C.\u2019s \u201cWelsh Rarebit\u201d programmes and it was during this series that the members of the choir and the programme\u2019s resident comedian, Harry Secombe, forged a strong bond of friendship. As a result of these broadcasts the Orpheus made its first records for Columbia. Yet despite the popularity of the broadcasts and the records, when the Orpheus entered the Pwllheli Eisteddfod in 1955 the choir was the only competitor in this field. Welsh choral singing was disappearing.","member_of":null,"members":null,"family":null,"originals":[],"covers":["476087","1232046","476086","1223243","476083","476085","476084","476076","135074","476088","108127"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":[],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":["149243"],"eps":[],"singles":["149238"],"performances_also_appear_on":[],"tributes":[],"added_by":"9","managed_by":null}

Born in Kiev of a Ukrainian father and Hungarian mother, he after serving in World War I, studied music in Moscow and continued studying in Berlin. There he also played at local venues with his own salon orchestra and changed his artist name to Dajos B\u00e9la (Dajos was his mother's maiden name), as Hungarian and Romanian music was 'hip' in Germany. His orchestra became one of the most popular in Germany and also gained a high reputation abroad. Upon the Nazis coming to power in Germany in 1933, Golzmann, being Jewish, toured outside the country. Arriving at Buenos Aires in 1935, he remained there for the rest of his life.","member_of":"120340","members":null,"family":null,"originals":["621191","1012315","501447","1382266","757886","824228","474467","779480","1468428","1267801","1496831","510721","621551","1504703","1193384","635605"],"covers":["231125","682320","1204636","870325","1195255","548815","501381","510914","1196135","1196510","476853","1203327","1214439","525446","625744","625747","665537","1303101","733588","587307","1193391","1193390","1209197","1091912","1203304","722581","888646","1203517","1173288","1196128","973819","1209196","1258426","1202865","476868","201521","501469","1194276","1049272","1423791","1202523","1202679","1210963","1228801","1202140","1202141","1204661","1210967","1203305","1202513","625746","1201494","231126","1203328","1513083","860950","1458154","635599","1205670","760787","986702","476861","1228971","45954","510841","260561","757999","973827","721358","1195252","1203516","621570","1258427","647793","1209453","694853","1201493","699605","1194689","694859"],"sampled_songs":[],"written_original_works":["279816"],"written_adapted_works":[],"albums":[],"eps":[],"singles":["188437","280026","202681","303066","326443","149403","324231","167736","324433","149401","326020","328984","198705","350513","216152","285961","178584","155034","372571","207156","325989","212729","255632","324431","327627","319228","222068","238710","338869","250521","155055","324045","385555","325852","328073","325748","227187","406722","332242","325828","189730","411111","395627","192088","326776","189729","222097","398284","157225","157294","332212","341194","188560","408940","327702","206159","325603","192091","324132","206161","248064"],"performances_also_appear_on":["294204","323840","324527","326080","148854","109307","276746","372569","188549"],"tributes":[],"added_by":"52961","managed_by":"62883"}
