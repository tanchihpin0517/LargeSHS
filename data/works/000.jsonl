The first printed version was published in 1917 in a collection compiled by Cecil Sharp. A version recorded onto phonograph cylinder in 1925 by a folk collector is the first documentation including a stanza about \"The longest train I ever saw\".  This stanza probably began as a separate song that later merged into \"In the Pines\". There are three frequent elements: a chorus about being \"in the pines, where the sun never shines\", a stanza about \"the longest train\" and a stanza about a decapitation but not all elements are present in all versions.  Many variants exist including references to \"Joe Brown's Coal Mine\" and \"The Georgia line\", challenging a woman (e.g. \"Little girl, where'd you stay last night?\" \/ \"Where did you get that dress? And those shoes that are so fine?\") and a hobo on the move during the great depression of the 1930s. In some versions the \"My Girl\" or \"Little Girl\" gets a \"Black Girl\". Researching the song for her 1970 musicology dissertation, Judith McCulloh found 160 different versions. These days, the song is mainly associated with the American folk musician Leadbelly (Huddie Ledbetter), who recorded several versions in the 1940s and on more recent versions is often credited as the songwriter.

Instead, she says that she had inadvertently put the lyrics into the public domain, and when Rose recorded the song, he copyrighted the lyrics.  According to Dobson, Fred Neil had made some minor changes to the lyrics when he recorded the song, and Rose made no significant alteration to the lyrics as altered by Neil.  Dobson clearly believes Rose improperly claimed a copyright for what is her work. Dobson's claim is certainly believable as Rose also claimed Hey Joe was a traditional song and copyrighted an arrangement of the song.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1035","36747","1054885","380304","12852","460293","55651","422365","55654","1359927","42841","36278","186325","272550","254171","55657","41728","1600551","1600437","293260","300092","810206","633039","42952","1600285","968839","262359","1494628","411081","881751","898814","142728","55663","1519399","105524","55659","1359621","926764","30711","55656","55664","1600508","1036","372986","1600290","221627","1600439","1359932","1359904","1104829","548920","33980","395327","105728","74488","811669","163107","425593","172730","848833","421548","1600452","1359616","430505","969232","1304440","1174430","1455868","376761","487042","299910"],"submission_ids":["154547","154805","155690","154912","154679","154549","154697","154677","154696","154695","154703","154704","181129"],"web_cover_ids":["19305","7038","7038","9124","9124","19309","20824","20824"],"type":"Song","added_by":"2","managed_by":null}

Early versions of this ballad were accompanied with varying tunes like \"Spanish Ladies\" and \"Get Along Little Dogies\".

The Banjo Song is itself an adaptation of Oh! Susanna (1948) by  (1848), which explains how Venus and Oh! Susanna are indirectly related. Most notably, Venus recycles the the guitar riff that can be heard in the first 10 seconds of The Banjo Song , a musical element that Tim Rose added.  This explains why Venus has little to nothing in common with Oh! Susanna , although it's a second degree adaptation of it.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"The Banjo Song written by Tim Rose","adapted_from_id":"88557","performance_ids":["173","1541484","1001885","118273","1542446","1509137","603480","976936","1351238","727528","1284772","363820","1263118","1530621","919473","596403","486","161223","1049444","1569650","389497","104057","1578417","219046","1578414","378760","520276","155312","830517","31326","8230","1036310","125859","1163631","794190","1196700","104056","249538","78234","69003","104060","387548","50518","144910","50059","466038","104058","1433815","527440","1047010","271545","1117668","1419971","793924","1587510","1368484","712225","371197","311977","16322","65190","66215","651231","165595","545213","1316782","1180513","514728","176668","727524","727534","1573893","893114","953349","252050","273720","430005","863752","1133723","478042","488140","634786","862581","951388","518769","1401334","1341481","1175308","1565767","1304692","1145079","351644","1599524","494749","1500220","1303078","1412919","1161102","592157","405019","1503234","382826","1566388","1510082","965182","1311824","436338","754398","685297","889884","485364","1248307","980801","1392384","1567750","1289754"],"submission_ids":["304845","307865","313924","113011","104209","78444","292794","74763","248739","122933","128076","160385","131040","174668","174669","202987","304877","163601","256817"],"web_cover_ids":["814","814","21520","9164","9164","812","812","10697","10697","24677"],"type":"Song","added_by":"2","managed_by":null}

It was actually recorded at the wrong speed and was not released until 1967 (not an error) as a 78 RPM single by Herwin, which did not correct the original recording speed error.  This version was again released in 1972 as part of the LP \"Bukka White Sings Sic 'Em Dogs On Me\" (Herwin, H 201).  The album was by various artists, and the title of the song was given as \"Sic 'Em Dogs On Me\" -- adding the \"Me\" to the original title.  In the track listing on the LP, Bukka is identified as \"Washington (Barrelhouse) White\".  The Lomax recording has appeared on several mediums through the years -- under both titles.  In addition, White recorded later versions of the song, which were released as \"Sic' Em Dogs On\" or \"Sic' Em Dogs On Me\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["102821","1423037"],"submission_ids":["148355"],"web_cover_ids":["18177","18177"],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

According to a letter from Jean Ritchie to Roger McGuinn published in the booklet included with McGuinn's CD, Treasures From the Folk Den , Sharp first heard the song from Ritchie's sister, Una, at the Hindman Settlement School in Knott County, Kentucky.

The horse, a gelding, was purportedly the top earning racer in Ireland in 1752, when he was 11.  The song apparently originated as a ballad about a high stakes race occurring in the Curragh in Kildare, Ireland in March, 1752, which Skewball won.  The 1784 publishing date is for the oldest broadside identified of the ballad and is held by the Harding Collection of the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford. According to John and Alan Lomax in \"American Ballads and Folk Songs\", the ballad was converted into a work song by slaves -- which is supported by the version of the lyrics published in their book.  \"Skewball\" apparently became \"Stewball\" after the song migrated to the United States.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1421204","417545","152505","391914","269971","787500","102927","102928","102925","102926","114812","578340","213137","114832","102930","773982","114819","114828","1063387","491305","399378","232837"],"submission_ids":["275318","275319"],"web_cover_ids":["6699","6699","13280","13007","13007"],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":"62883"}

The pair had been seeing each other for several months when, on Christmas Eve 1900,  Moses boasted in Delia's presence about his sexual relationship with her.  She denied the sexual relationship, and during their argument called him a \"son-of-a-bitch\".  Shortly thereafter, Moses shot Delia, who died on Christmas. Howard Odum collected a fragment of the ballad in Newton, Georgia sometime between 1906 and 1908.  It is #59 in the second part of his 1911 collection of African-American secular songs published in the Journal of American Folklore.  This version, a three verse fragment called \u201cOne More Rounder Gone\u201d, implies Delia was a prostitute. Newman Ivey White\u2019s 1928 American Negro Folk Songs, includes a five verse variant, \u201cDelie\u201d, collected in 1924 from Frank Goodell of Spartanburg, South Carolina, who reported he learned it sometime between 1900 and 1904.  It\u2019s thin on details regarding motive for the murder.  White includes two other fragments which may be part of the same song, one from 1915 or 1916 in Alabama and the other from 1919 in North Carolina. Early US versions of the song like \"One More Rounder Gone\" and \"Delia\" were originally accompanied by the traditional \"Frankie and Albert\" tune. But when the song migrated to the Bahamas, new lyrics were added and the tune was also adapted. As early as 1935, Alan Lomax recorded a local version on the Bahamas by The Nassau String Band. Virtually all subsequent versions would use this same form.

When Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein, also owner of the original's publishing company, found out to what extend those four bars had been used, he enforced assigning the entire songwriting credit to Jagger\/Richards. This resulted in Ashcroft and Verve (as arrangers) being left without any publishing income for \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\". As of April 2019, an agreement was settled via Klein's son and the Rolling Stones' current manager. Jagger\/Richards signed over all their publishing in the song and also stated in a press release that Ashcroft had been denied the rights to \"one of his most iconic songs, including the lyrical content\" for more than two decades.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"The Last Time written by Andrew Loog Oldham -\n                            The instrumental backing composition was taken from a symphonic recording of the song by The Andrew Loog Oldham Orchestra and sampled through main parts of The Verve's recording.","adapted_from_id":"233411","performance_ids":["10471","1012449","503656","10482","116596","54941","1583737","363545","196318","494849","276738","290576","481093","1594013","486915","952892","469459","686216","447186","1304902","474049","645847","486394","1587417","596414","1012447","1274280","794418","672762","763519","1271275","790482","1205194","1180798","1056000","1214878","1248871","1309857","1414566"],"submission_ids":["211307","123518","123479","173069","187554","255809","215772","270589"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3","managed_by":"50304"}

It was also renamed \"One Love\/People Get Ready\" and co-credited to Mayfield. Speculations are that Island Records intended to prevent a copyright infringement case and that Marley agreed in order to pay respect to Mayfield.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["105012","721364","323205","282300","481035","907054","390103","105013","510384","907037","382971","1345657","651194","417151","975398","370227","1538471","219519","140155","204860","924650","483057","832935","540469","1335054","1312290","799069","863855","584876","222749","147950","1171726","287110","1510470","1136967","907026","572409","718963","631321","847616","1310674","718946","718206","697866","1327702","1025117","1027779","1072213","1223935","1393098","1535552","1035371","219385","670382","495901","541351","428727","1115244","870868","415930","1233152","839898","1076639","1048221","1120990","1113286","1129941","516430","1129611","834904","1129098","967119","596974","596973","819653","1127505","1211139"],"submission_ids":["198135","280339","105130","232043","175072","202610","38914","229835","163607","258994","271009"],"web_cover_ids":["5685","5685","24034","24034"],"type":"Song","added_by":"30","managed_by":null}
