While most musicologists seem to believe that the ballad is based on a historical event, this is disputed.  In any event, there is no historical record of a Sir Patrick Spens, although some contend he was actually Sir Patrick Vans. The most popular view is that the ballad recounts a voyage to Norway that Alexander III of Scotland dispatched to return his grand-daughter, than 7 years old, to Scotland.  The girl's mother, Margaret, had died in childbirth, making the grand-daughter, the Maid of Norway, the heir to the throne.  The Maid of Norway did die on the trip, but not in a shipwreck. Another view is that the ballad actually chronicles a voyage Margaret took in 1281 to marry Eric II of Norway.  During the return voyage, a ship transporting many of the nobles who had accompanied Margaret to Norway drowned when that ship sank.  Unfortunately, this historical incident does not otherwise really fit the ballad.  A third theory maintains the ballad is based upon the combination of the two events.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["105584","105586","360116","111148","171482","105579","105580","105601","105581","111151","111143","105593","477160","105582","105588","111150","404802","404813","105606","811319","275734"],"submission_ids":["283671"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":"99660"}

Similar ballads exist in, at least, Denmark and Germany, which may all have a common poetic source.

(It is collected in the Roud index as song 51.) In this ballad, a young man or woman dies, and his or her lover mourns at the grave site for \"twelve months and a day\", preventing the deceased from finding peace.  This is apparently based on an old belief common at one time in many communities that mourning a death for longer than one year deprives the deceased of rest.  In this ballad, the deceased pleads with the mourner to leave, and the mourner requests a kiss, which is denied on the grounds that it would be fatal to the living one.  This is apparently also an ancient belief among certain peoples. Like many folk songs, this one is known under several names, including \"Cold Blows the Wind\", \"The Restless Grave\", \"The Resurrected Lover\", and \"Lost Jimmie Whalen\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["105936","105937","111153","256511","111154","105934","105933","115271","1039919","113458","105930","111155","292835","930219","105932","105935","855326","322470","105929","105941","1049293","105931","978764","360992","105939","1040927","1002223","1054867","105940","313081","105938","523462","1027102","360658","1288737","523458","1289107","1044855","1069155","523457","1289600","1058068","351213","332723","366553","1484866","1031606","1589888","1463478","1289146"],"submission_ids":["240254","56908"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":"99660"}

Neither Lord Franklin nor any of the voyagers returned to England. Some assert the ballad was written by Jane Griffin (Lady Franklin) but this appears apocryphal.  Lady Franklin was apparently devoted to Lord Franklin and sponsored four expeditions to attempt to find out the fate of Franklin. The ballad is known under several other names, most notably \"Lord Franklin\" and is collected as Roud 487 in the Roud Folk Song Index. The melody, which predates the ballad, was also used by Bob Dylan for Bob Dylan's Dream . The publishing date is for the song in a broadside version, which may actually have been anywhere between 1850 and 1855.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["502541","106303","106293","106302","1036369","106297","1085355","181186","180915","275934","1598201","113561","364486","235043","115295","960558","115291","155565","1477003","106301","401280","1197725","1556874","169803","115286","115287","1096030","358949","375306"],"submission_ids":["233153","314909","295611"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

Its original publication was under the name \"Lady Mary Anne\". In most versions of this song, a daughter complains that her father has betrothed her to a boy several years her junior.  (Depending on the version the groom is as young as 12 years old.)  The couple have a child and the boy dies -- all before he has ever left his teens.  Despite the girl's initial reservations about the union, she is brought low by her young husband's death. Some believe this song is based on the marriage of young Lord Craighton to Elizabeth Innes, who was several years older than him when they wed.  He died in 1634 some three years after the marriage.  Undoubtedly, at least some lyrical variants do refer to this marriage, but the scholarly consensus is that the song long predates Craighton's marriage as child marriages were relatively common in the Middle Ages and there are much earlier similar historical cases.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["359407","168714","117421","106782","155592","358879","387976","1049355","106790","239426","145818","106791","1007698","399953","106786","1042454","106787","522833","106792","171580","309971","278181","318481","1382647","278199","106784","774331","1096305","1089094","1595425","522841","490069","106794","1054983","1067820","283127","1064431","503550","106783"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

Several theories concerning the song's origin have been suggested, but none are particularly convincing.  In fact, it is uncertain whether this ballad originated in England, Scotland or Ireland.  \"Barbara Allen\" migrated to North America, where it was one of the most popular folk ballads. Scholars have identified four basic tunes and four basic sets of lyrics for \"Barbara Allen\", although there are many variations, with one source claiming to have collected 98 different versions in Virginia alone.  The basic story is the same in all versions -- a young man is dying of unrequited love for Barbara Allen, who is called to his bed side and is, at best, indifferent to his situation.  After the young man dies, Barbara Allen experiences a change of heart and dies of grief. This folk song is collected as Child Ballad 84 and Roud 54.  The song is known by many names, most variations in title simply constituting different spellings of \"Barbara\" or \"Allen\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["108017","181360","527456","181931","1070794","1047440","459454","181933","417534","350408","110278","108003","107997","1011400","1041632","108025","938357","155570","459441","107994","1030322","776853","375353","107992","134652","252182","503292","350447","366807","1037727","1288660","108027","255692","357566","107969","1074164","115838","501191","319952","1088376","171481","255675","239437","501166","973319","1293587","396885","1413247","917744","141262","107991","290674","107970","247741","173279","1088956","1047313","255407","1057294","441768","338424","255640","1002670","107998","507821","923038","358862","181180","255713","255467","1597377","169222","255453","107975","967409","855188","1260725","960754","171578","965295","235858","169142","828961","290657","266648","360729","598024","991923","108033","108032","1047427","108031","285141","1097485","108001","269108","982626","738574","502854","290648","290647","108036","477159","108034","107982","352040","166003","498707","169979","190507","1060338","519977","1057574","360881","555630","111755","473392","1289212","169140","874930","1289110","554233","1067790","361175","1176307","279269","421649","1545766","503555","290103","361488","1017686","421236","1057009","769213","769212","814220","1199849","929618","1019606","370882","967765","1200006","1575352","975134","751523","1096975","612621"],"submission_ids":["262155","289571","123219","158389","97915","236482"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

Without an original 1931 recording, it's hard to establish, if the melody was changed much. 'Slim' Freeman is mentioned as the \"fifth\" individual to receive songwriting credit.

Although this song is credited to Jimmy McHugh and Dorothy Fields , there is significant doubt about this putative authorship.  In his biography of Andy Razaf , \"Black and Blue: the Life and Lyrics of Andy Razaf\", Barry Singer discusses a 1929 piece from \"The New York Post\" about Fats Waller , in which Waller mentions selling a song to a white composer, who put it in a \"musical comedy\", where it became the show's hit.  Waller was known to sell songs, and this description would fit \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love (Baby)\".  There is also evidence that McHugh purchased another song from Waller that McHugh copyrighted in 1935. As to the lyrics, Singer reports that Gladys Redman, Don Redman's widow, went to visit Razaf when he was in the hospital in the early 1970s.  According to Gladys, she asked Razaf to sing her his favorite of the lyrics that he had written, and he sang in a hushed voice, \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love (Baby)\". Another story is that the song was originally intended as a tribute to Charles Lindbergh and was known as \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Lindy\", but that Fields rewrote the lyrics.","licensing":"Request a synchronization

It was played on a harp with dancers circling around who would improvise lyrics in a game. But the song is widely known for its English title \"Deck the Hall(s)\" and has become a Christmas standard. While this tune is thought to date from as early as the 16th Century, it was first found (untitled) in John Parry\u2019s manuscript \"Twelve Airs for One and Two Guitars\" (1781). It was then published in \"Musical and Poetical Relicks of the Welsh Bards\" by Edward Jones (1784) titled \"Nos Galan\" (English: \"New Year's Eve\").
