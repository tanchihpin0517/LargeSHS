The song dates back to the sixteenth century, one early variant being published in broadside form circa 1660. It is also known as, among others, \"James Harris\", \"The Demon Lover\", and \"The Ship Carpenter\". In this ballad, a woman, now married with child, runs into a former beau who convinces her to leave her husband and child and sail away with him.  Less than a month at sea, the ship sinks and the woman dies.  In the earliest versions, the former beau is either a demon spirit or the devil taking the form of the former love, called \"James Harris\" in some versions; hence this alternative title for the song. The ballad became very popular in Appalachia and the American South as \"The House Carpenter\" -- which is usually the  occupation of the husband being deserted. The supernatural elements of the ballad are stripped out of most of the American versions of the song. The first recorded version of this \"story\" was made in America by the Carolina Tar Heels on October 11, 1928, with vocals by Doc Walsh. Their song was titled \"Can't You Remember When You Were Mine?\". On April 14, 1930, Clarence Ashley (who was a member of the Carolina Tar Heels) recorded his version called \"The House Carpenter\", and it is Ashley's version that \"took\" and became the model for most of the American \"The House Carpenters\" to follow.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1048209","110574","1048208","796673","417516","110582","935529","839084","1044688","111161","648631","1041434","110579","1057858","110567","110578","193347","110575","489542","324411","496774","484923","1049357","110572","110566","1032665","110583","1047290","1044797","168857","110568","256572","1091470","110570","728653","390803","1042433","113123","111162","110569","401137","1091489","110573","275799","1066484","1036274","110571","1092834","110886","1046626","982628","232104","1044737","1056768","111158","1049904","1091468","111157","357903","361573","1045790","110584","911268","516720","285154","1051199","1287888","111156","1068591","1202163","1018676","1474278","1484861","1073947","1033092","1178183","910694","110577"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":["11014","11014"],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":"99660"}

The first publication date of the earliest known extant broadside of this ballad actually occurred between 1607 and 1641, the years in which its publisher, Henry Gosson, was in business.  A verse from the ballad is also used in a play by Beaumont and Fletcher entitled \"Knight of the Burning Pestle\" circa 1611, although the ballad may date back to as early as the 13th century. Lady Barnard convinces Little Musgrave to sleep with her as her husband is away.  Lord Barnard returns unexpectedly, kills Little Musgrave in a duel and his wife thereafter after she states a preference for the dead Musgrave.  In some versions Lord Barnard commits suicide.  Although some have speculated the ballad may be based on a historical event, no real evidence of this has been offered. This is a very popular folk ballad that is found in Great Britan, Ireland, Canada, the United States and Jamaica.  The many versions of the ballad show much variation in the name of the lord (for whom this song is sometimes named) and the lowly lover, often named \"Matty Groves\", another title under which this ballad is well known.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["168693","111175","111169","400701","115270","111168","1088361","169472","1091510","111180","1044786","111170","169273","154470","281080","111166","168691","111174","1549751","111167","281081","281186","111179","1091492","1202284","168688","297561","1382650","115294","111181","285142","269109","422240","957041","1091437","522844","536144","1074897","111171","1076911","111176","318721","490723","281082","374972","1047808","1068593","788050","481666","1066385","1563856","1546202","1091232"],"submission_ids":["32574"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":"99660"}

The opening words and refrain of Ellen's song, namely \"Ave Maria\" (Latin, \"Hail Mary\"), may have led to the idea of adapting Schubert's melody as a setting for the full text of the traditional Roman Catholic prayer Ave Maria. The Latin version of the Ave Maria is now so frequently used with Schubert's melody, that it has led to the misconception that he originally wrote the melody as a setting for the Ave Maria.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["491375","1105689","464890","763488","1370359","1311098","813178","207180","1164148","1334577","386098","465263","1313629","954950","981822","312501","562469","1073036","186368","1217384","1049109","215423","1100218","1024935","135042","494820","390784","120856","194789","499526","1005599","254409","340934","253606","977979","241890","825624","609395","216862","183052","252207","282458","1475059","675295","927142","939730","201290","213480","235245","120496","642696","1282487","1271992","294413","636838","333068","120495","350243","687441","120498","214950","385338","308607","296652","291409","194778","610775","584411","584825","460106","124702","517207","295370","295747","288211","184385","1135680","212777","626003","1101303","840853","554986","564366","1437750","412339","528421","783845","651378","1269182","1272863","1095076","873662","763803","772757","753136","1048913","1293802","1044360","1301450","1301683","1301165","1403261","1266430","1399727","1399972","1297756","1400353","1400130","1498435"],"submission_ids":["141286","221234","250007"],"web_cover_ids":["8487","8490"],"type":"Classical work","added_by":"2841","managed_by":null}

The different versions follow the same general lines, the primary character (in this case Randall, but varying by location) is poisoned, usually by his sweetheart. Variants include \"Jimmy Randal\", \"Henry My Son\", \"What Had You for Supper\", \"Buried in Kilkenny\", and \"The Wild, Wild Berry\". The traditional song Billy Boy is based on this ballad, and some have suggested that Bob Dylan's A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall is structurally based on \"Lord Randall\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["855854","350407","772439","1049977","115273","171488","115264","281808","338261","186026","1061127","1047464","360062","375358","115278","115265","401408","115269","115268","978278","256436","169385","501172","338984","1136607","115272","1047287","1048868","256573","115266","1024204","115275","1089003","808551","254689","1084408","115274","420258","115276","418060","285155","361009","1067804","811320","389757","400838","1103632"],"submission_ids":["61200"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":"72827"}

The song is known under many names (The Seven (Yellow) Gipsies, Raggle Taggle Gipsies, etc) and is probably best known (particularly in the United States) as \"Black Jack Davy\/David\". In this ballad, a fine lady is abducted or abandons her husband (and often children) to go with the gypsy laddie.  She is pursued by her husband, but refuses to return to her fine home, preferring the gypsy (abducted or not).  In some versions, the lady is retaken by force and the gypsy (or sometimes, gypsies, including accomplices) are hanged. Child considered this ballad to be historically based in the expulsion of the gypsies from Scotland in 1609, and the hanging of a prominent gypsy, Johnny Faa, for returning or failing to leave Scotland.  There is no account, however, of any expelled gypsy taking a great lady.  At some point, a localized and\/or corrupted version of the ballad was published that used the name of Lord Cassilis as the wronged husband, resulting in a story springing up that Lady Cassilis had merely acquiesced in her marriage to Lord Cassilis, while being in love with Johnny Faa.  The story goes that Faa and a band of gypsies eventually came to take her. The group (including Lady Cassilis) was apprehended, the gypsies were hung, and the lady locked up by Lord Cassilis for the remainder of her life.  Child, himself, debunks this story as ahistorical. Scholarship after Child's time strongly supports the idea that \"The Gypsy Laddie\" is not a historical ballad but, rather, belongs to the ballads based on medieval romance.  More specifically, there is strong support for the conclusion that this ballad actually originated as a humorous rewriting of the far more obscure ballad \"King Orfeo\" (Child 19), which it quickly surpassed in popularity.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1047441","117409","117410","417531","1043974","169626","292790","769201","117425","221795","523472","776844","1290639","117420","1057310","1039270","117521","187143","1128391","357567","169749","400148","1057289","117416","436633","1095368","195605","193349","117508","117424","171480","1088362","117502","930123","1097432","117526","460676","169383","1290647","117524","397950","1028680","492232","1049333","491096","1075129","1290645","1290649","117522","1573050","1030186","117501","1066088","117517","117511","117523","117419","117422","1568977","1290651","358127","1088312","1097414","1055224","1084371","256576","1588912","239442","1290652","1525663","1057293","1106062","1290654","117519","169159","674175","420672","1047687","1589388","117525","360175","1290653","658116","155306","1047426","1036366","190439","360991","992142","490072","157420","1147319","977235","418162","136473","782241","435505","420256","119256","1084386","1531565","117735","190554","285158","1290663","1027857","674227","963307","148631","352271","1037585","401162","1091205","1290667","331887","1571133","1044963","1066087","1287001","416292","1061913","361489","618974","320510","1580665","1074886","427661","1081466","1591946","1580620","910692","1536798","1452249","437861","701867","1592963"],"submission_ids":["289570","123220","259354","259691","256991","259684","88688","294651"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":"99660"}
