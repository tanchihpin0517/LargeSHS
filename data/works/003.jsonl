The first lines go as follows: Dig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow Dig a hole in the cold, cold ground Dig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow Gonna lay darling Corey down There is lyrical similarity between \"Darlin' Cory\" and the traditional song Little Maggie , but the tunes are different and ethno-musicologists consider them to be separate songs.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["119371","923063","119382","119386","423172","269981","119390","119393","982985","119400","401359","1001994","815500","1091180","949851","484927","119378","961863","949873","923214","1052996","975447","982306","953934","289253","254686","155282","1016644","1070843","119391","916860","119401","1035714","949864","675935","1056685","774487","931099","1042963","1036268","1045735","410888","400840","1045777","604891","155375","529426","774415","1084621","921022","125408","119380","1053825","949832","937705","119402","438950","363561","1060867","119403","1321455","157884","962231","1094805","119397","460656","1042658","1051825","1041202","1091250","1010583","1076587","177199","1018675","1476562","1034860","531494","554720","927892","940869","1031599","1023139","521854","950681","1021150","1065394","1279489","1178562","119381","305819","1377969","1047043"],"submission_ids":["161275","310437","279688"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

Some submit that it is a folksong of American origin which migrated to Ireland where it became wildly popular.  A second group, including the Clancy Brothers, assert it is of Irish origin and migrated to the United States.  Others dispute its authenticity as a self-contained folksong.  Alan Lomax contends it is a derivative work of two other folksongs, \"The Wagoner\" and \"Rye Whiskey\".  Others claim \"The Moonshiner\" incorporates elements of popular song more associated with a middle-of-the-road repertoire of professional singers of in the late-19th century and, thus, isn't really even a folksong. There are some versions called \"God Bless the Moonshiner\" that have varied the verse lyics, but shares the same general theme and tune. The publication date is for Carl Sandburg's \"The American Songbag\", in which the first known appearance of the song made under the name \"Kentucky Moonshiner\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["956578","1046755","123900","355631","1066527","963108","162462","1089601","483973","123913","1054887","394346","461152","169663","123899","1068080","255716","1158736","123921","967453","956139","123912","123901","123916","205462","123915","332451","169672","981385","355624","290651","1056932","167630","1060861","1022963","958023","123902","943551","143528","788030","169137","1164226","1087662","1176293","1051870","568760","933748","1042601","1076790","1195382","1184501","972540","1085069","1574546","1361095","1592653","557716","1600099"],"submission_ids":["287309"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}
