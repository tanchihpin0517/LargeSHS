Higley originally called it \"My Western Home\".  The poem was published in 1873 in the \"Smith County Pioneer\" as \"Oh Give Me a Home Where the Buffalo Roam\".  A patient of Dr. Higley's persuaded him to have the words put to music, resulting in \"Home on the Range\". The song quickly spread throughout the country, spawning lots of lyrical variation and disputes over the song's origins. Composition of the song has often been ascribed to David Guion, who arranged a popular version of it in the 20th century.  The actual writing credits of Kelley and Higley are now firmly established.

It was originally marked by Jesse Chisholm, and connected a southern trading post he owned near the Red River to a second trading post he owned near Kansas City. It was not used as a cattle trail by Chisholm, who died in 1868.  The trail, which actually has a number of feeder trails, was ultimately expanded both south and north to accommodate cattle drives, and saw some 3 million head of cattle traverse the route between 1867 and 1872 alone.  The trail fell into disuse in 1882. Cowboys working the cattle drives learned to sing when herding cattle so that their compatriots would know where they were; thus, avoiding driving stampeding cattle at fellow cowboys.  The cowboys also sang just to keep themselves awake during long dreary night rides and watches.  \"The Old Chisholm Trail\" was very popular with cowboys, who would make up their own verses for the song.  Some sources claim there are literally thousands of verses to the song.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1509621","1509640","1096232","307562","1096215","1096795","891597","307728","1096593","155435","1040107","1096757","1509652","307579","307582","1032840","676075","155589","1509770","359613","168971","187519","1509763","422862","1509660","187144","531308","505172","239433","1461439","1509753","1509741","1509704","1509733","632167","960498","155443","187251","155448","155439","1096325","1043426","155466","866092","155453","1509760","620422","1070519","1027846","1023983","863142","866089","1449772","1024959"],"submission_ids":["286688"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

According to Alan Lomax, \"Such songs were performed by the professional entertainers who toured the gold camps, and were circulated in the little pocket song books of that day.\" Though earlier versions may have existed, it is believed that John A. Stone wrote much of the song that is normally sung these days. Stone, who died in 1864, had crossed the plains from Pike County in 1849-1850, with a small singing group, the Sierra Nevada Rangers, which toured the mining camps. His published version appears to have omitted some of the bawdier verses which were probably sung in the camps. (Commentary by Raymond Crooke and reprinted here.) Stone apparently just wrote the lyrics; which, like many songs now called \"traditional\", has many  variations.  The tune was apparently taken from an English dancehall song called \"Vilikins and His Dinah\" (or some variant thereof) which was written by Parry.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Villikins and His Dinah written by [Traditional]","adapted_from_id":"311585","performance_ids":["155550","1046925","181932","155551","1023909","1096812","1060613","155552","477379","155561","1055250","1144786","1057312","1068125","782186","155549","155562","359611","1142638","960283","1051538","309544","290457","169955","1043671","1051537","1053044","187154","155560","974144","632177","187252","328547","1321458","349511","1082142","155564","1023948","1173050","868690","517714","518013","1547198","270345","581393","676555","978645","155568","978984","1028657","1150087","491409"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

The poem was originally published as \"A Border Affair\" in the June 1907 issue of \"Pacific Monthly\".  It was republished in 1915 by Chapman & Grimes as part of a compilation of Clark's works entitled \"Sun and Saddle Leather\". The song ended up with several variant lyrics. Although there has been some controversy about whether Bill Simon actually composed the tune, that is the consensus nowadays.  Simon heard the poem, thought it would make a good song and worked out a tune, while riding the range as a cowboy.  Some twenty to thirty years later somebody added a bridge to the music, which is how it is now typically played but, as with the lyrics, there is variation in the tune.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["283158","283159","1398364","283155","364407","155599","598975","1067449","155569","403502","187401","1398366","1258568","952009","960573","155597","169954","205250","155595","155606","1012155","155580","1022049","155590","155607","1012158","155598","155596","155610","169156","1088286","733218"],"submission_ids":["286687","291834","287553"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}
