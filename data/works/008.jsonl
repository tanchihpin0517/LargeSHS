There is debate over whether \"Reynardine\" should be considered a folk adaptation of \"The Mountains High\" at all or, instead, whether A.L. Lloyd actually should be deemed the author of the song, although Lloyd claimed it to be a genuine folksong.

Tom Dula, pronounced \"Dooley\" in the part of North Carolina from which he heralded, was twice convicted of the murder and was ultimately hung in 1868, slightly less than two years after the murder.  The verdict remains controversial to this date. The motive for the murder is uncertain.  Some sources claim that Laura Foster was pregnant with Dula's child, and the pair were to elope on the day that the murder occurred.  Many believe the murder was actually carried out by Ann Melton, who had been Dula's lover.  A third lover of Dula's, Pauline Foster (Ann Melton's cousin), introduced syphilis into the group, but Dula and Melton appear to have blamed Laura Foster and one or both of them may have killed her in revenge. Some sources state or imply that the song was actually written by Captain Thomas Land, who had a local reputation as a poet.  Land did write a poem entitled \"The Murder of Laura Foster\", which was intended to be read - not sung - shortly after the murder occurred. It is lyrically not the same as \"Tom Dula\". It is entirely possible that Land's poem and the song \"Tom Dooley\" were independently created, albeit based on the same event. Whatever its origins, the song quickly became popular in the North Carolina area.  Some of the early recordings were made by artists who had relatives who knew the protagonists or who were involved in the events.  The first commerical recording of the song was by G.B. Grayson & Henry Whitter in 1929.   G.B. Grayson was the nephew of Colonel James Grayson, who employed Dula for a week while he was on the run and who led the arresting party.  Doc Watson, who recorded the song in 1964, learned it from his grandmother who knew Ann Melton and who may have been present when she died.  An important version that did not have a direct connection to the events depicted was by The Folksay Trio.  This version was the first to include the pause between the words \"Tom\" and \"Dooley\" in the chorus. In 1937, song collectors Frank and Ann Warner recorded Frank Proffitt performing \"Tom Dula\".  Proffitt was another who had a familial connection with the song, learning it from his grandmother who knew both Tom Dula and Laura Foster. Frank Warner released his own version in 1952, after having shared the song with Alan Lomax, who published it in his 1947 collection entitled \"Folk Songs USA\".  This was the source of the well-known version by The Kingston Trio, which was successfully sued for copyright infringement for using the arrangement appearing in the Lomax book.  The case was resolved with an agreement that future profits from the Kingston Trio version be paid to a company owned by Frank Warner, John Lomax and Alan Lomax.  An arrangement seems to have been made by the trio with Proffitt, whereby he received 50% of the profits payable to the trio's company.  Because of this case, the song is often credited to \"Trad.\/ arr. Lomax\/Warner\/Proffitt\".  Proffitt released his own version in 1962.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["923046","171486","600452","168843","168925","168842","174563","262093","316141","277046","170781","474546","614220","782002","168952","169874","1024441","1081519","168847","168849","800798","168956","1014896","1413055","168841","1012477","882673","265784","1373656","168864","168961","599175","379952","1141786","391666","1078926","168962","168858","361115","338420","954097","1160775","1120722","685203","975922","968015","525786","434408","1549619","515229","504508","501097","1095935","1016412","860127","841038","1155160","600878","721230","344194","168859","169144","172289","664889","1259886","169127","205458","1050446","937715","169134","1257458","243753","324947","961684","168963","897196","498249","184946","168856","579112","277926","169138","291980","446035","940216","1090888","252964","252708","1557813","1390902","769206","979141","765582","523809","1017820","1534888","1535993","1385344","860627","561969","1555345","346287","169050","1103203","1254192","1118477","1323512","1250588","1072504","685744"],"submission_ids":["43753","249963","191334","29010"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":"62883"}

Its first publication as words with an associated tune is dated to 1611 under the title \"The Marriage of Frogge and the Mouse\". The song is known under many names, including, \"Froggie Went A-Courting [or \"A-Courtin'\"]\", \"The Frog Came to the Myl Dur\", \"Frog in the Well\", \"The Frog's Wooing\" and \"The Frog and the Mouse\".  It is collected in the Roud Folk Song Index as Roud 16 under the primary title that appears here. The song may have originated as a satire of Queen Eizabeth's habit of giving animal nicknames to her ministers. A version was created to express popular displeasure over her proposed marriage to a foreigner.  Sir Walter Raleigh was known as her fish, Leicester her lap dog, and at the time of her proposed marriage to the Duke of Alencon and Anjou, Simier, the French ambassador was her ape; the Duke himself her frog.  The song actually became something sung in nurseries and passed down that way over the generations. The odd marriage party gets out of hand, with different outcomes to the participants in the various versions, ranging from death to frog and mouse to living happily ever after.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["169370","169345","169366","169346","169365","169362","985692","1047445","417918","169368","169387","171495","1041635","169372","1039281","169173","420679","256033","169176","1052755","169380","169219","1049551","418072","400147","1298860","169373","929362","169216","169266","951526","169272","1036697","1303971","169394","1259134","169170","834114","169386","783014","418117","169203","935604","1089166","169382","1582381","597057","169388","169267","169376","169172","1557829","170269","1050458","169171","169454","1567241","986555","1058651","334207","972510","517722","1053394","337239","175552","676303","935605","361487","522038","1091076","966577","1076976"],"submission_ids":["95656","280490"],"web_cover_ids":["17310"],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}
