Although not a true folk song, there is significant lyrical variation in the song today, and the copyrighted version by Allen is also included in John and Alan Lomaxes' \"American Ballads and Folksongs\" Macmillan Co. 1934). This book also presents a composite \"Ballad of the Erie Canal\" put together by the Lomaxes from versions of the song they had found over the years. This is not the same song as \"Low Bridge, Everybody Down\", and the Lomaxes were not sure of the original melody  to \"Ballad of the Erie Canal\". Canal workers who transported barges up and down the Erie Canal did, in fact, sing songs of their own invention while working. This was motivated by the same reasons that cowboys created songs - to combat boredom and stay awake when working long stretches of time. The Roud Folksong Index collects the Allen song and variants as 6598.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["182130","182131","182139","868378","1040103","769238","1054241","1172499","776194","182153","423217","186971","1054019","529633","1095390","182179","182146","1413048","474569","1088373","182148","1466023","1049288","944212","285147","1241339","346876","328527","558026","424348","205677","517717","334218","518008","524178","187427","1054022","842259","1576875","1052575","261673","1336144"],"submission_ids":["250731","283667","286906"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

It is collected as 122 in the Roud Folk Index.  The song is known under several other names besides \"The Sweet Trinity\" and \"The Golden Vanity\".  The earliest known version of the song comes from around 1635 as \"Sir Walter Raleigh Sailing in the Lowlands\". Also known as \"The Merry Golden Tree\" or \"The Golden Willow Tree\". The captain of a variously named ship, most often The Golden Vanity, expresses deep concern over the ship's safety due to the presence of an enemy ship usually of Turkish, French or Spanish sail, and in American versions, British.  A cabin boy offers to resolve the danger, and the captain promises various rewards if he will do so.  The cabin boy swims to the enemy ship, bores holes in its hull, and than swim backs to his own ship, whereupon the captain refuses to make good on his promises and usually will not even let the cabin boy back on board so he drowns.  In some versions the cabin boy proceeds to sink the ship on which he served, using the same method of boring holes in the hull.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1456523","186030","186016","281809","311489","186040","1039268","1057311","186042","1036304","186032","186036","186043","1088357","186031","960815","1136701","489727","397951","1041691","186027","982321","1036900","243715","256583","475357","186017","313649","1597370","186014","270104","1067782","1036277","1037370","1096304","1592352","1037373","931198","395734","1054930","1037374","186044","285156","1030353","363569","1010688","1058663","1057006","690166","1037368","186041"],"submission_ids":["275959"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

We have not been able to determine which was recorded or released first. Many sources say that this song was introduced by Blanche Ring in the musical comedy \"The Defender\", which opened on July 3, 1902.

However, there are two versions of verse for the song. The first one - written by Norworth in 1908 - references a heroine called \"Katie Casey.\" In 1927, Norworth wrote (and copyrighted) alternative lyrics, replacing \"Katie Casey\" with a new heroine called \"Nelly Kelly\". The different versions of verse do have some similarities but also significant differences, however the chorus is the same in both versions. No one knows for sure why Norworth wrote the new 1927 verses. One plausible explanation is that by doing so his \"new\" version was covered by copyright after the \"old\" version had passed into the public domain. Another suggestion - from historian Jean Hastings Ardell - is that the 1927 verses celebrated new freedoms enjoyed by women in the 1920s: Nelly's demands to go to the ballpark are stronger than Katie's pleas. Here are the first lines of the 1908 verse: Katie Casey was baseball mad, Had the fever and had it bad.
