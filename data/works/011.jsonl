Way down in Columbus Stockade. Friends have turned their backs on me.\" \"The \"Columbus Stockade Blues\" by Thomas Darby and Jimmie Tarlton, was written and recorded in 1927. Many famous artists have since played the song in band, jazz, blue grass, country and blues arrangements. These two brick buildings served as jail and police headquarters from the 1850s to 1906. Then the buildings were joined and appear today much as they did when the song was written. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\" Frequently, artists attempt to take credit for writing old songs that were, in fact, written by others or come from a traditional source. The most notable example for this song was by Jimmie Davis and Eva Sargent who copyrighted \"Columbus Stockade Blues\" in 1943, more than 15 years after Thomas Darby and Jimmie Tarlton recorded it.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["216936","216938","216939","216951","216942","216952","920970","848394","216953","373401","410045","500130","225742","943139","1032531","216955","228140","941948","337589","1107630","365507","973334","389687","1051662","881856","1033280","227530","941951","800064","736427","895131","941467","855365","216954","920975","526302","1433336","511693","1033284","1094155","1542729","946807","392602","308270","941621","1012913","1124945","651672","674176","581309","1557761","941960","941961","942015","981406","1107466","1047570","369821","1114683","305975","216937","958905","946795","1561176","1077533","756063","1056120","733162","1099874","425757","962226","283245","1174566","352118","927445","1304603","1563854","966573","1223982","1372035","997568","1428819","954607","1428833","884136","928264","408448","429929","328957","437647","1407834","357180","1320964","1083254","1522944","1033275","973607","1485222","941966","1107537","946794","975133"],"submission_ids":["88639","88600","155218","88601","88608","88597","88629","286669","88644","88641","88643","88647","88734","88650","88651","88656","88657","88653","88652","88666","88654","88667","88671","88717","88721","88714","88729","88722","88723","88715","88725","88726","88727","88731","88732","88733","88760","88728","29601","88604","88730","88630"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"6487","managed_by":"62883"}

Many of the Vinson songs are mistakenly credited to Henderson\/Young\/Lewis.  Bill Monroe's 1957 recording erroneously credited Henderson\/Young\/Lewis, and now most of the bluegrass versions follow suit - but they have no lyrical or musical relation to the Henderson work. I'm sitting on top of the world, I'm rolling along, I'm rolling along. I'm quitting the blues of the world, Just singing a song, Just singing a song.
