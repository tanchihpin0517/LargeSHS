She showed Woody an article about a Philadelphia lawyer being shot in Reno, Nevada.  He found it humorous and penned the song \"Reno Blues\".  As was the case with many Woody Guthrie tunes, the music was based on an older tune, the music from \"The Lone Green Valley\", also known as \"The Jealous Lover.\" (The music is also related \"Omie Wise\" and \"Banks of the Ohio\"). Woody and Lefty Lou performed this song in bars all over California, but never recorded it.  Rose Maddox learned the song from them and recorded it as \"Philadelphia Lawyer\" (which is how it's known now).  Woody recorded \"Philadelphia Lawyer\" in 1944 and it was eventually released in 1964.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Lone Green Valley \/ The Jealous Lover \/ Pearl Bryan written by [Traditional]","adapted_from_id":"237283","performance_ids":["228446","228448","1443066","805310","1071374","231242","970117","231408","902015","627447","1113583","931702","1101896","228450","973033","972806","981415","941472","971538","1062749","801771","459473","1495506","1099041","387735","387995","958866","926030","1003670","744371","953159","267249","957712","558130","1010003","445025","367759","1079707","463111"],"submission_ids":["158040"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"6487","managed_by":null}

Since the Fort had only recently been completed and there was still a lot of debris on the parade ground, they were set to work cleaning up. Two Maine recruits sang a simple song as they worked called \" Say Brothers, Will You Meet Us? \". Harry Hallgreen of the Tigers picked up the song and taught it to other members of his battalion. Among the Tigers was a certain Sergeant John Brown who came in for a lot of ribbing because he had the same name as the man who had been executed at Charlestown, Virginia, for trying to cause a slave revolt. Eventually Hallgreen invented a new line for the \"Say, Brothers\" song to spoof the lively activities of Sergeant Brown: \"John Brown's body lies a mouldering in the grave\". Another member of the Tigers, James Greenleaf, added the tag line: \"His soul's marching on!\" More verses were added later. Greenleaf was organist of a church in Charlestown and he had naturally much to do with the early arrangement of the notes of the song. Mr C.S. Hall, an acquaintance of Mr Greenleaf often visited Fort Warren, and becoming interested in the song, he took hold with his friend to see what could be done with it. Mr. C.B. Marsh also helped and the result was the composition of additional lines and the issue of the production as a penny ballad, on common printing paper, surrounded by a pretentious border. It bore the imprint: Published at 256 Main Street, Charlestown, Massachusetts  (for a picture: see ATTACHMENTS) Later, Mr Hall issued a more elaborate copy, giving both words and music, and headed it with a cut of the national bird. It bore the words Origin, Fort Warren. and Music arranged by C.B. Marsh At the bottom was the print as before, and a statement that it had been Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1861, by C.S. Hall in the Clerk's office in the District Court of Massachusetts. (for a picture: see ATTACHMENTS) This Fort Warren song was the one Julia Ward Howe was referring to when she later wrote \" Battle Hymn of the Republic \" not the Methodist hymn \" Say Brothers, Will You Meet Us? \".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Say Brothers, Will You Meet Us? written by [Traditional]","adapted_from_id":"43760","performance_ids":["238922","1586351","1595807","779107","1241393","292801","1047790","401417","958411","360821","1054600","505162","367365","997281","359297","797265","797279","584255","1422619","583904","593217","503118","356944","1074448","1493142","260428","1547629","553097","346832","1214579"],"submission_ids":["266783","124044"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"23","managed_by":null}
