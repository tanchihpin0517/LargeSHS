The song rapidly became popular and was performed by several minstrel groups in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and other locations throughout the U.S. in the 1860s.

There is a bluegrass version called \"Across the Blue Ridge Mountains\". It has been found in Scotland, England, the United States and Canada. The Folklore Center at California State University at Fresno provides this summary of the lyrics for a common version of this song: \"A (soldier) and a pretty girl meet; they chat and he plays on the fiddle for her. When she asks him to play more, he says it is time to leave. She asks him to marry; he already has a wife and children\". There is a wide range in the music used with this song. For example, the version recorded by Jo Stafford in the 1940s employs the same tune used a decade later by Dominic Behan when he recorded \"The Patriot Game.\" Bob Dylan used the same tune a few years later when he wrote and recorded \"With God on Our Side.\" On the other hand, the version recorded by Bob Atcher in the 1940s uses a tune closer to that of \"Rye Whiskey\" or \"Jack of Diamonds.\"","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1014152","263333","248529","248535","769210","283150","1037276","1056641","604247","483968","1063017","982836","1025824","934385","1048934","373971","248635","248536","940334","1016477","400464","1039229","387936","1095896","1083755","247910","1036269","964710","1058387","1089090","961475","1063020","371620","1038221","1091225","963397","1076369"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":["23535"],"type":"Song","added_by":"6487","managed_by":"99660"}
