Retrospectively, one could argue Yablokoff wasn't entitled to any compensation, since his composition Shvayg mayn harts was itself based on an element of the second movement (\"Dumka\")  of Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k 's Piano Quintet No. 2 .

The song is about a true naval event.  Admiral John  Benbow started out in life as the son of a tanner.  He joined the British navy at age 25, and ultimately rose to the rank of admiral - a remarkable feat given his family background. Early in the War of Spanish Succession, a group of ships commanded by Benbow fought a French naval group in the Caribbean between August 19 and 24, 1702.  Although the British group had seven warships to the four of the French, only one of Benbow's commanders would follow his orders and engage the French.  Benbow was badly wounded during the engagement and died from his wounds on November 4, 1702 in Kingston, Jamaica.  His courage made him a naval hero, particularly among Britain's working class. Benbow did live long enough to see his cowardly underlinings court-martialled for cowardice.  Two of these officers were executed after Benbow's death. Two different basic set of lyrics are performed as \"Admiral Benbow\" using the same tune.  Moreover, there is considerable lyrical variation within the two sets of lyrics, but all are a commemoration of Benbow's heroism.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["255013","255053","1088941","523117","255054","364033","255056","255012","983360","284844","277831","401144"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

The lyrics deal with the boll weevil, a beetle, which feeds on cotton buds and flowers. In 1892 he came crawling in from Mexico into Texas, with all of his little friends and relatives. When they'd eaten up Texas they migrated to Louisiana in 1903 and another five years later to Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. Many songs about the boll weevil, with varying tunes and\/or varying lyrics, were recorded by blues musicians during the 1920s through the 1940s. However this Texas version (with the familiar just looking for a home verse) collected by John Lomax in 1909 from a blind singer (probably Madkin Butler) from Hearne, Texas and subsequently recorded by Leadbelly in 1934 and (his best known version) in 1939, led to its becoming well-known. The tune of the most familiar versions are very similar with the melody of Frankie and Johnny Not to be confused with the so-called Alabama version of \" Boll Weevil \" which has a different melody and some floating lyrics. nor with Boll Weevil Blues as written by Cliff Hess , nor with Blind Willie McTell 's \"Boll Weevil\",","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1371130","1578916","1095363","1578584","935584","1166276","574271","1040113","1046550","775284","1209306","772453","1053926","982982","1033412","1054035","255163","929308","1175634","401409","1019849","823380","917221","916625","1413050","1012481","1112619","1091544","566940","474974","338421","983124","960029","255164","1088252","802807","923142","1572464","1059961","840007","1021332","913009","1033816","469570","1036240","1310772","1041207","989791","440916","1195792","1060350","1027764","977245","1071345","1064026","1097076","1056998","1042893"],"submission_ids":["264693"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"1074","managed_by":"25"}

The ballad originates in Scotland or England and was first published in \"Scots Magazine\" in 1803, but the ballad has been traced back to at least the 1770s.  This ballad in different forms is known in, among others, Denmark, Sweden and Iceland.  The Danish version has been traced back to 1598. In this ballad, an outlaw comes upon three sisters and demands, in turn, that each marry him on pain of death.  Most often, the first two sisters refuse and are murdered.  The youngest sister accidentally determines that the murderer (named Babylon in a version collected by Child) is her brother and he commits suicide when he discovers this fact. The ballad is known under several names, often localized to the area in which the song is found.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["256510","256501","256491","256492","256494","256559","256557","256495","256522","1184066"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

The short version of the ballad's story is that a maiden agrees to marry, and proceeds to get consent from various kin, but neglects to ask her brother John, who stabs her.  Given the unreasonable rage of the brother, some commentators on the ballad have suggested an incestuous relationship between brother and sister.  The sister-victim lives long enough to write a will, and which she reveals her brother to be the murderer.  This ballad was published in 1776, but it appears to have originated long before this publication. The ballad is also known under many other names, including \"The Three Sisters\" (which can be confusing because Child 1 is  also sometimes known as \"The Three SIsters\"), \"The Three Knights\", \"Brother's Revenge\",  \"Lily O\", and \"The Rose and the Lily\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["256580","256586","256589","256571","256584","256574","256575","256585","256577","256581","256582","256526","256588","256579","939000"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}
