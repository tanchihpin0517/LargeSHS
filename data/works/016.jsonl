It is listed as Child ballad 209 and Number 90 in the Roud Folk Song Index. The ballad was traditionally sung across the English speaking world, particularly in England, Scotland and North America, and was performed with many different melodies and lyrics. There are two distinct and for the most part separate variants of this song, one deriving from 17th century English broadsides and sung by traditional singers in England, Ireland and North America, the other printed in one 18th and some 19th century ballad collections and collected from Scottish singers and some North American singers. Most influential version is Joan Baez's 1962 recording, based on a traditional version from Somerset, England.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1596377","1594699","267645","476499","358915","267652","267651","267646","267640","1053320","267638","1039922","515160","634283","291365","338990","282070","1054892","1236703","940562","1594689","1085245","1036970","279855","1044862","579215","279856","1050176","1054902","313230","767079","1058390","1289170","1287893","1050749","420255","285157","1288738","342686","1088963","1069085","401161","275735","375308","1044868","1049559","1049585","1093316"],"submission_ids":["288091","26721"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"19","managed_by":null}

Although bowdlerized in some versions, this is a bawdy song about a sailor who meets a woman, progressively fondles parts of her body, has sex with her and catches a disease, with the woman leaving him after his money is gone.  Traditional songs with lyrics of a progressive seduction are relatively common place. This song has been performed under several names.  It appears that in the oldest versions of the song, the woman lived in Amsterdam, and the work has also been recorded several times as \"Maid of Amsterdam\".  In other versions, the woman is from Plymouth. The precise age of the song is unknown, but it is at least as old as 1866 (Songs of Columbia: With Music and Piano-forte Accompaniment), with estimates of it dating to the 1500s having been made.  Some have claimed that the shanty is derived from a 1607 or 1608 play by Thomas Heywood, \"The Rape of Lucrece\", although this contention seems to have been rejected by most musicologists who have researched the song.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1589192","1588582","1422199","1519884","269891","269874","269881","269867","269895","269888","269894","269889","1054058","506877","404739","269871","269887","1512925","983366","1050820","284734","357945","269890"],"submission_ids":["85045"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

The play is one of several variants of the medieval tale of patient Griselda, as also told in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.  In the script, this lute-accompanied lullaby is introduced simply by the sub-title \"The Song\" (as are other songs in the play).
