The ballad is possibly first referenced in 1549 in Wedderburn's \"Complaynt of Scotland\", although there is some doubt that the reference was to this ballad.  A version was definitely published by 1769. The ballad's story revolves around a maiden's encounter - usually named Janet - with a supernatural being.  Janet ventures to Carterhaugh, where she and other maidens are forbidden to venture because Tam Lin resides there and is known to take the virginity of maidens.  Janet becomes impregnated by Tam Lin, which her father notes.  In some variants, Janet is told of a herb that will induce an abortion, but she returns to Carterhaugh to find Tam Lin.  Tam Lin reveals he was once a mortal man but was captured by the Queen of the Fairies.  He further explains that every seven years, the Queen of the Fairies sacrifices one of her people as a tithe to Hell, and believes he is to be sacrificed that very night!  Tam Lin explains that Janet can rescue him by pulling him off his horse around midnight when he is taken to be sacrificed.  Janet succeeds in doing this, enraging the Queen of the Fairies, who nonetheless concedes defeat.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["275717","275723","275787","275716","275807","275802","400958","275796","275715","275892","275722","275798","275725","275718","275730","357902","275720","402268","1069124","421643","275737","1086699"],"submission_ids":["298161"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":"2"}

It was collected around 1840 in Limerick by Patrick Weston Joyce and also in Donegal by George Petrie.  It is 2355 in the Roud folk music index. The song tells of the narrator and his cousin, Arthur McBride, being approached by three military recruiters - the recruiting sergeant, a corporal and a young drummer.  To ensnare the unwary, recruiting sergeants were reputed to be both silver tongued yet capable of ruthless skulduggery.  In this case of attempting to induce the narrator and Arthur McBride into military service, the recruiter extols the virtues of serving the King, having money and wearing nice clothes.  Not taken in, Arthur responds that, though fond of their country, if they joined, the pay would be low, the clothes would merely be loaned to them and they would be made to go to war in France where they would almost certainly be killed.  The recruiter, taking offence, becomes angry and threatens to use his sword whereupon Arthur and the narrator attack the recruiters, throw their weapons into the sea and leave. The roots of the song are uncertain.  There is some speculation that it references the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th Century.  However, it has also been surmised that the song goes back to the late 17th Century, especially the Williamite War in Ireland, since the reference to being \"sent to France\" suggests the departure of the disbanded Irish Jacobite army from Ireland to France, as a condition of the Treaty of Limerick in 1691.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["281448","281398","281424","281392","281443","1089727","281446","281406","281436","281447","281449","281402","961541","1595383","281458","671691","516549","1403242"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":["6607","6607"],"type":"Song","added_by":"4544","managed_by":null}
