It was later more successfully recorded by Ricky Skaggs. The song was actually written by Arthur Q. Smith and purportedly sold to Eanes, as Smith had sold him many of his songs. Smith also sold a 1\/2 share of the song to Paul H. Jones, and retained the other half. When Skaggs' recording came out it was initially credited to Eanes, but once it became a hit, Smith's widow, Lillian Pritchett, sued the publisher. As Eanes couldn't show proof he had purchased the song, the song credits were transferred out of Eanes' name over to Smith's estate and Jones. Eanes went to his grave attesting that he actually wrote the song.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["288975","450276","935285","929655","973275","1002191","1106409","929959","930258","1605820","490161","498724","455317","288976","562181","923901","1518608","1352539","963908"],"submission_ids":["294191"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"9","managed_by":null}

There is some doubt and uncertainty, however, as to whether the words might have been written before the music.  A week later, it was performed by Elizabeth John from Pontypridd, in the vestry of Tabor Chapel, Maesteg. Over time the song gained popularity, initially in the locality but soon spreading across Wales.  The song became better known still after the 1858 Langollen Eisteddfod, after Thomas Llewelyn from Aberdare included it in a volume of unpublished Welsh airs he compiled for a competition entry.  The adjudicator, John Owen (Owain Alaw) then published the song in \"Gems of Welsh Melody\", published in 1860 by Isaac Clarke, Ruthin, under the title \"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\" [Land of My Fathers] from its opening line. Owain Alaw included the song in his own concert repertoire and it was adopted by other contemporary popular soloists, with notable performances by Lewis William Lewis (Llew Llwyfo) at the 1866 Chester Eisteddfod and Robert Rees (Eos Morlais) at the 1874 Bangor National Eisteddfod.  By the Caernarfon Eisteddfod of 1880, it was adopted as the Eisteddfod song and has been sung at every Gorsedd ceremony ever since.  It was increasingly sung at various patriotic gatherings and gradually developed into the Welsh national anthem.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["294475","779944","779943","308454","308860","1232510","781596","301925","294476","779938","294477","294478","294479","400165","441047","1231053","294480","1254563","294481","294482","1305744","301995"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"4544","managed_by":null}
