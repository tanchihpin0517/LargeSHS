Gershwin was aged 20 when this song was written.  He and his lyricist, Irving Caeser, maintained they wrote the song in about ten minutes, starting in a Manhattan bus and completing it in Gershwin's apartment.  It was intended in part to be a parody of Stephen Foster's Old Folks at Home . The song was introduced In \"Demi Tasse\", which was part of a Vaudeville revue at the Capitol Theatre, opening on October 24, 1919.  In \"Demi Tasse\", \"Swanee\" was a big production number, featuring some 60 chorus girls.  Al Jolson heard Gershwin play the song on piano at a party and ultimately interpolated it into his current show \"Sinbad\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1364043","861885","1364036","1364035","1364047","1364038","1050171","1216242","1313408","1202962","1338184","861657","1509179","1160811","409129","1422803","605322","1228558","1309122","691118","978922","996641","1252474","438774","502571","1377560","1217513","588205","1315115","674061","1032174","1506771","1243199","674341","597354","674312","674299","1100487","1138596","818564","1033956","1254480","582041","417574","1302446","1187914","1408855","674363","1249317","500699","1071029","526136","1280062","500844","1539421","1005186","1154067","1052449","807254","341429","1154848","796762","1289719","1072543","1052534","581056","1173301","1219460","944464","703295","581343","937193","443161","1468264","1154362","916531","754778","1456989","1200191","1208516","298049","298198","937190","1261746","540942","1364040","1458366","1219910","547762","1220665","1377623","347091","406444","714931","1252525","373247","361306","1433418","362302","1377641","539315","1381598","1320501","1581191","307420","1315778","1377651","471606","298074","1076059","425920","880916","1216670","642736","1295579","584252","1246012","569463","586119","552438","1506726","1217783","1298306","1217821","407685","860709","1218258","892468","1085468","1159314","1251777","298039","1406877","1244636","582438","800686","365297","1202628","859540","1241131","343159","1323137","1234317","1219400","1318523","303388","1219938","321178","437318","298076","1240745","1468102","644924","473000","1241041"],"submission_ids":["160141","162507","163122"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":"62883"}

Adapted from a mid-19th century poem from Edward Hubbell Chapin, \"The Ocean-Buried\", the song was transformed by the end of the 19th century into a cowboy song as it was carried westward.  Most performances are named \"(Oh) Bury Me NOT on the Lone Prairie\", but can also be titled \"(Oh) Bury Me OUT on the Lone Prairie\". Some of the performances titled \"Bury Me OUT...\" actually use the lyrics of a related 1934 song by Carson Robison called Carry Me Back to the Lone Prairie (e.g., Roy Rogers' \"Bury Me out on the Lone Prairie\" and Johnnie Ray's \"Oh Bury Me out on the Lone Prairie\" ). NOTE: There is different song without the word \"Lone\" in the title called (Oh) Bury Me out on the Prairie that can be confused with this song.  The other song has a very different melody. Vernon Dalhart recorded both versions, his 1930 Oh Bury Me out on the Prairie & his 1927 Oh Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairie . Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie These words came low and mournfully From the pallid lips of a youth who lay On the bloody ground at the close of day","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["318026","318023","1048040","943123","1100024","1096449","1049531","558950","863589","891598","155438","1033076","477381","307581","559320","1096739","676073","1537422","1054649","559323","318021","1555333","187518","1043749","187400","255696","363048","1095399","1096764","505168","169636","91183","713670","371379","941768","154886","1089939","313721","358176","1055589","1094708","1506815","154877","1043425","872495","13690","1023940","1070520","1060340","1037382","166894","1052569","1030824","1065975","1567052","1070981","1571169","1526051","834243","423148","676136","1089600","834066","1345996","1036906","1358882","1031685","720915","437457","1024954","346131","1152036","437276","1057551","1529157"],"submission_ids":["253822","253821","227654","256392"],"web_cover_ids":["20817","20817","14396"],"type":"Song","added_by":"5","managed_by":"72827"}

It was first published by Carl Sandburg in \"The American Songbag\" under the title Lydia Pinkham (writer unknown). Lydia Estes Pinkham (February 9, 1819 \u2013 May 17, 1883) concocted a herbal tonic claimed to cure or ease all manner of \"female complaints\", mass marketed from 1876 as Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and becoming commercially successful.  In addition to roots and herbs, the compound also contained alcohol. The song celebrates and magnifies the cure-all claims, with verses describing how the poor fortunes of various women were reversed after experiencing the invigorating effects of the compound.  It has entered folk tradition and many different versions have evolved, with variations applying to men as well as women and the claims transferred to other products.  It is speculated that the song's popularity might have increased in the US prohibition era since Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound remained available as a medicine and became a legitimate source of alcohol.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"My Redeemer written by Philip Bliss , James McGranahan","adapted_from_id":"136334","performance_ids":["304239"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"4544","managed_by":null}
