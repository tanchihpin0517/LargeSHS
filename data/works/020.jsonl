Its lyrics come from a poem Reverend Henry De Lafayette Webster, a Presbyterian minister in Zanesville, Ohio, wrote in 1856 after family opposition blocked his marriage to nineteen-year-old Ella Blocksom, who sang in his choir.  After the relationship ended, he resigned his post and shortly met Joseph Philbrick Webster, who set it to music. The heroine was originally called Bertha, but the composer altered this because he needed a name with three syllables.

The band registered the song as their own but the lyrics came verbatim from two traditional songs.  The chorus came from All Around My Hat and the remaining lyrics were from Fare Thee Well, Cold Winter \/ Farewell He .  After the initial opening chorus, the Steeleye Span song becomes a rocker and musically differs greatly from the original folk songs, and thus warrants adaptation (recomposition) status.

English and Scottish versions of the song both existed in the Eighteenth Century, making provenance debatable.  The song appears in several broadsides, dates unknown.  The publication date shown above refers to James Oswald's \"Caledonian Pocket Companion\".  The song has also been published in several other collections, principally Scottish.  An English variant was published in The Journal of the Folk Song Society, vol. I, issue 3, 1901, on which many recordings are based, and is also collected as 1644 in the Roud Folk Song Index.  In 1821, the tune of Low Down in the Broom was used to accompany the words of The Red Red Rose, a traditional song collected and poeticised by Robert Burns, in Volume 2 of Robert Archibald Smith's \"The Scottish Minstrel - A Selection from the Vocal Melodies of Scotland\", published under the title My Love Is Like a Red Red Rose .","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["318949","318950","318951","318952","318954","318956","318955","319111","1265403","1014306","321764","675142","1025697","575665"],"submission_ids":["199385"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"4544","managed_by":"2"}
