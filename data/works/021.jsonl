For example, in James Johnson\u2019s \"The Scots Musical Museum\", published shortly after Burns\u2019s death in 1796, the lyric was set to a melody by the Scottish fiddler Niel Gow, entitled Major Graham\u2019s Strathspey, which had appeared in Gow\u2019s 1784 \"A Collection of Strathspeys and Reels\".  Johnson added a second version of the song entitled Old Set, Red, Red Rose, of which the old set referred to a tune called Mary Queen of Scots.  In 1799, George Thomson included the song in his publication \"A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs\", this time to the air Wishaw\u2019s Favourite, which was composed by the north-east English fiddler William Marshall.  Ultimately though, another Eighteenth Century tune, Low Down in the Broom , became the standard accompaniment we know today after the words and tune were matched in Volume 2 of Robert Archibald Smith's \"The Scottish Minstrel - A Selection from the Vocal Melodies of Scotland\" published in 1821.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Low Down in the Broom written by [Traditional] The Red Red Rose written by Robert Burns , [Traditional] , Pietro Urbani","adapted_from_id":"138268","performance_ids":["319466","319664","319665","985846","319722","319787","350410","319779","1073685","319728","1073393","319750","357214","356741","1404972","1425782","372775","1159167","372787","356343","319666","1286980","1530442","1530441","357217","319668","319667","1321388","372803","401841","321765","1286988","1582392","363663","1329272","738569","319669","321762","319670","1594161","319672","319671","511004","1289101","401763","321763","1186231","327957","1288416","321761","1329348","871129","1375680"],"submission_ids":["259371","259373","259369","314045","259372"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"4544","managed_by":"2"}
