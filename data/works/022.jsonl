It's a straightforward song about a sailor leaving home and the loved one. He's extremely fed up with the Senior Service and he'd rather be outside, but he has to go away yet again. On occasions like this I think the close of the first day out, as the sun is setting, is the time when we're most vulnerable to nostalgia. There's a shanty with the refrain \u2018Rock and roll me over for one more day\u201d, and this gave me the idea for my own refrain \u2018It's one more day on The Grey Funnel Line\u2019.\" Tawney sang the song at party in December 1960 that was recorded by Louis Killen (and played back to Tawney in 1964).

The earliest printed version now known for the ballad is circa 1780, published in \"A Collection of Garlands\". The work is collected in the Roud Folk Music Index as number 904. There are at least two distinct folksongs known under the name \"High Germany\", with different tunes and lyrics. The second version is more commonly known as \"The Two Lovers\" or \"True Lovers\" and is collected as Roud 1445. The versions here generally begin along the lines of \"Polly, dear Polly, the rout has begun\". (In Irish versions, Polly is often switched to \"Colleen\".) Roud 1445 starts along the following lines: \"Woe be to the orders that took my love away\". Roud 904 and 1445 explore the same subject -- a young man and his lover lamenting over the conscription of the man to go to war in Germany. \"High Germany\" refers to the southern part of the country where it is mountainous. In Roud 904, a young man, often Willy, is conscripted to fight in \"High Germany\". He attempts to convince his lover to dress like a man and join him in the war. \"Polly\" professes her love, but declares she is not fit for war. \"Willy\" attempts to persuade her to change her mind, stating that he will buy her a horse to ride, and that they will eventually wed. \"Polly\" still refuses and laments that her man has been drafted away from her. There is considerable debate over the war responsible for the origination of this ballad, with some arguing it is ahistorical. Assuming, as seems probable, that the song is historically placed, the two most likely wars from which the ballad originates are the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) or the Seven Years War (1756-1763) (the North American front of which is referred to as the French and Indian War). In both of these wars, the English fought in \"High Germany\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["332486","332502","332484","332700","332487","332640","1085403","332717","332729","332721","332639"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

According to the rules of this edition every song was performed in a double performance by a couple of singers or groups. In this case by Tony Dallara and Renato Rascel. Rascel performed the song as a soft ballad, while Dallara, who was considered by Italian music critics as one of the \"urlatori\" (screamers), a music style popular in Italy during the 1960s, gave a more powerful rendition of \"Romantica\". The song was also chosen as the Italian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1960, where it was performed in Italian by Renato Rascel.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["334985","1035336","1021238","1037911","1036716","1035895","1036849","1036949","1036858","1037425","847123","1019733","1035564","1036054","1037944","1036181","1036865","1038681","1037455","1036868","334984","1037315","1036395","1037599","1035385","1243646","990682","1023495","357430","1037054","520791","1022712","993599","622240","622252","1039568","906204","1531323","1606748","1539820","1441402","872818","1039529","1007358","742163","1023759","1174956","1139941","1216754"],"submission_ids":["243452","226178"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"19","managed_by":"78739"}
