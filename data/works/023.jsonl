The lyrics were copyrighted on September 26, 1863 under the name \"Louis Lambert\", which was a pseudonym used by Gilmore.  Gilmore disclaimed writing the music, stating that he adapted it from an African-American spiritual. The melody for the song was previously published in July, 1863 under the title \"Johnny Fill Up the Bowl\" -- an American drinking song.  The sheet music for this work credits a \"J. Durnal\" as the arranger of the music, but not its composer. The song \"Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye\" -- an Irish anti-war song now sung to the same tune as \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\" -- first published in 1867 is also claimed by some to predate \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\", which is said to be a reworking of \"Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye\".  Although the latter song was published later, some contend that it actually relates to the return of Irish soldiers from Ceylon; however, Irish troops were stationed there from at least 1837 until 1866, so that versions of \"Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye\" which refer to Ceylon (all do not) are not inconsistent with the notion that \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\" is the earlier work.  Moreover, it seems unlikely that \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\" is a reworking of \"Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye\" because as originally published, the latter song used a different tune. Many lyrical variations were put to the tune originally used for \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\" over time.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["346067","346056","346068","975772","346058","346069","346585","346065","932769","517967","346837","346893","346070","346127","1028973","725062","409525","1377030","346838","346635","1244409","505475","346124","775862","346108","1410258","1054606","346846","346831","760644","497930","826393","1323315","346313","399812","583904","374570","584203","593217","755260","1540610","1540636","1016409","1099413","346912","346863","1050834","428510","474591","1050797","346883","346873","370171","346126","1097514","346871","346903","1070198","434093","346836","432511","346869","1049820","346872","1035644","1507369","1054484","346066","1061428","346278","346829","346270","346301","346267","346568","1228479","346763","1350956","346307","346298","346782","346565","346284","346651","1222771","1486990","928282","346584","346581","1277417","1211327","346676","1216779","1487027","346667","346659","1566504","1155804","532309","346088","445985","346071","346269","850426","1106379","346634","346293","1042674","346649","403250","346840","523906","965537","346850","1289776","596608","503443","346875","346128","1025168","579822","1101688","1114199","635403","426467","636688","1460757"],"submission_ids":["194062","304194","118610","218690","255262","303852","129159"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":"2"}

The theme is related to \"The Cowboy's Lament\" and \"St. James Infirmary Blues.\" Texas Gladden's version of this song was recorded by Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress in 1941. Several well-known singers including Nina Simone and Barbara Dane based their performances on the Gladden recording. When I was, a young girl I used to seek pleasure, When I was a young girl I used to drink ale; Right out of the alehouse and into the jailhouse, Out of a barroom and down to my grave. Come Papa, come Mama, and sit you down by me, Come sit you down by me and pity my case; My poor head is aching, my sad heart is breaking, My body's salivated and I'm bound to die. Go send for the preacher to come and pray for me; Go send for the doctor to heal up my wounds; My poor head is aching, my sad heart is breaking, My body's salivated, and Hell is my doom. I want four young ladies to bear up my coffin, I want three young maidens to carry me on, And each of them carry a bunch of wild roses, To lay on my body as I pass along. One morning, one morning, one morning in May, I spied this young lady all clad in white linen, All clad in white linen and cold as the clay.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"The Unfortunate Lad written by [Traditional]","adapted_from_id":"271902","performance_ids":["417738","769220","349502","349501","349503","366108","1602653","1460407","488488","733047","349506","726345","1063384","414706","868547"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":["15891","15891"],"type":"Song","added_by":"6487","managed_by":"99660"}

In October 1926, The Hill Billies recorded the first lyrical version which they called \"Blue Eyed Girl\". The West Virginia Coon Hunters released a variant called \"Blue Eyes Run Me Crazy\" in 1927.  There is a fiddle tune called \"Suzanna Gal\" (or \"Susannah Gal\") that has modified lyrics. Some of the early Appalachian variants were called \"Little Betty Ann\".  There is a variant called \"Fare You (Thee) Well, My Blue-Eyed Girl\". The Iron Mountain String Band recorded a variant they called \"Western Country\" in 1973. Not to be confused with Pretty Little Miss out in the Garden , as both versions can be called \"My Pretty Little Miss\" or \"Pretty Little Miss\". Typical lyrics - Fly around my pretty little miss Fly around my daisy Fly around my pretty little miss You almost drive me crazy The higher up the cherry tree The riper grows the cherries The more you hug and kiss the girls The sooner they will marry","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["350431","1011531","975857","1014763","1090652","973889","1090926","1092597","929324","1057379","1029384","1027117","1065418","960124","1095138","1025649","1096993","1056108","1077042","1097879","1036921","961298","350432","350437","350453","350446","1032711","1032566","350454","937392","1099636","350440","1030900","982830","936256","975859","1041605","1002669","1041384","1056098","1065320","940333","975858","1036909","1041901","923098","1090002","1046101","1088044","975864","1091490","1097071","1014948","1042962","1097322","1093064","937389","1082145","1050449","1037538","820815","982581","1057377","942179","1092538","1044823","1005414","967752","1057583","1091397","1092147","1076620","1056097","1078329","1029087","1027306","1096031","1090891","960061","1046771","1076222","1087486","1021146","1170369"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"6487","managed_by":null}

It is often incorrectly attributed to \"Traditional\", and additional verses have been added to the work over time, as is common with traditional songs.  The entire lyrics to Brackett's work are: Tis the gift to be simple, 'tis the gift to be free, 'Tis the gift to come down where we ought to be, And when we find ourselves in the place just right, 'Twill be in the valley of love and delight. When true simplicity is gain'd, To bow and to bend we shan't be asham'd, To turn, turn will be our delight 'Till by turning, turning we come round right.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["401416","400146","352219","686151","352208","1237508","541794","359982","352196","1540637","1526965","944219","391076","391015","1323663","1513348","1058652","1334677","352206","391072","497637","479973","564580","1053403","777710","352209","1167605","1268158","1084644","1443979","395883","352253","1373066","1605436","1099318","932420","352249","634079","1385397","1579010","390991","950891","1261499","390994","391007","579747","390978","352255","696693","665029","391001","391028","944884","390977","352247","953593","609688","558123","390997","390996","391078","352207","390993","391079","1517103","1514305","391075","390999","1029078","391077","1026532","391086","615991","586003","767891","861916","1272794","575658","504640","569203","1517220","863554","1294644","1301324","1301569","1511505","1508209"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}
