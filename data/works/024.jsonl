The young Napoleon promises that he will capture \"the bonny bunch of roses\", namely, Great Britain.  Mary Louise tells her son about his father's disaster in Russia and warns him not to follow Napoleon to his grave.  In fact, the young duke died in 1832 at the age of 21 from tuberculosis. Because of the song's pro-Napoleon sentiments, it is generally thought to be of Irish origins as the Irish had suffered from British oppression in the 18th and 19th centuries, although it was popular throughout the British isles, and has been found in Canada and the United States.  It is collected as number 664 in the Roud Folksong Index.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["358855","358933","358917","358920","358877","358881","358853","358852","358856","358861","358857","358945","358952","401143","358937","1068606","358935","358948","375303","358928","1057361","358940","358954"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

They claim to have lost him or sent him on a distant job, but the ghost of the dead man appears to his lover and reveals the truth. Accused by their sister, the brothers are forced to flee. Various versions have been discovered as broadsides.  From its style and certain key phrases, the song's history is estimated to date to the early 18th Century but it has since evolved through oral tradition in both southern England and eatern USA and Canada.  It is known under many titles, including Bruton Town, The Bridg(e)water Merchant, The Merchant's Daughter, The Murdered Servantman, The Cruel Brothers.  The earliest broadside now known (pre 1845) is entitled The Merchant's Daughter and Constant Farmer's Son.  The title adopted here for the SHS database is that used in the Roud Folksong Index (#18) and Laws Ballad M32 published by the American Folklore Society, based on early 20th Century publications. The story told by the song has a longer history.  It derives directly from one of the many English translations of \"Isabella and the Pot of Basil\" from the Decameron (IV, 5) by Boccaccio, a 14th Century Florentine collection of novellas.  It has been conjectured that this work too was based on earlier tales.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["360850","360853","360860","360858","360862","360865","360863","597491","360868","360864","1039948","360869","361569","360880","360867","362307","360870","1069148","361013","1074001"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"4544","managed_by":null}

A nonsense song that originated in the halls and pubs of summer-season Llanwrtyd Wells but which became associated with Llanelli and adopted as a rugby song. First sung in summer 1895 or 1896 with just the words from Mynyddog's poem, it was expanded with further verses and a chorus by Williams.  An additional bridge was added circa 1911 by persons unknown referring to Dai Bach the soldier (which was possibly a mishearing of \"the solderer\"). Llanwrtyd, a spa town in rural mid-Wales, became a popular holiday destination following the construction of railways, particularly for workers from the industrial south who valued the clean air and supposed healing qualities of its water.  Llanelli was a centre of metal manufacturing and nicknamed \"Tinopolis\" or \"Saucepan Town\", so the song was fitting and carried back by its workers.  Sospan Fach is now an anthem of sorts for Llanelli and for the Scarlets, its rugby club. The publication date above refers to the printing of the song in the South Wales Daily News.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Rheolau yr Aelwyd written by Mynyddog","adapted_from_id":"144116","performance_ids":["1232511","361813","361798","361792","1037634","361950","361809","361793","361805","362146"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"4544","managed_by":null}

During a break between performances, Felix played the music he had written to lyrics previously written by George. George did not like what he heard and the song was put aside. However, later that year they revised this work as a marching song in order to win a song competition. They won first prize and the resulting song, \"Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag,\" became one of the biggest hits of World War One.  The announcement of the prize winners was made in August 1915. The following Monday they incorporated the song into their musical revue, \"Some Glee.\"","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["363140","875207","362290","362288","875372","399548","399550","974603","1344304","582981","362289","875029","414113","600086","958409","587319","582700","600790","577187","1546774","584189","1246055","592485","584349","569663","1406881","573268","660101","1145269","606317","1400514","1375504","1254127","1460669","1344430","1344299","665764","1344433","595383","1252474","1254818","592176","1248624","1251437","1535289","464535","1072448"],"submission_ids":["257483","219994"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"6487","managed_by":null}
