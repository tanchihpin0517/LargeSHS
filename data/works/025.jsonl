For years it has been customary just about these camp meeting days that one refrain sung at colored bush meetings becomes popular and is chanted everywhere, There is one air which is heard nowadays and it is known as \"Pharoah's Army Got Drownd-ed.\"","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["705731","705744","705758","705947","705749","708346","706816","782078","710237","531396","1011583","705617","742018","742023","742019","363682","782079","1173644","978381","725064","877493","1405992","977406","1040564","1455844","805418","710656","961398","391280","885618","1437922","728098","1083305","1258802","870674","537828","1177959","859755","1107726","1167305","1383969","448857","1082907","581089","974810","871083","1582449","1051696","1022427","1126964","817104","1490562","759613","1269679","720469","972958","1460543","783034","802106","1363422","999688","1180500","792808","800599","860579","742211","588728","739374","1083200","742017","1533508","1205215"],"submission_ids":["62370","62180","200392","62237","62186","62187","62178","62188","62191","62365","62195","62194","62414","62275","62346","62203","62467","62308","62316","62206","62261","62257","145664","62351","62248","62208","62461","62432","62345","62464","62262","62375","62367","62417","62430","62229","62259","62436","62437","62439","62376","62382","62428","62429","62438","62209","62416","62420","62217","62341","62418","62419","62380","62381","62255","62293","62378","62292","62360","62362","62271","62331","62343","62349","62350","62352","62353","62250","62324","62326","62327","62329","62263","62282","62315","62320","62321","62323","62265","62277","62294","62295","62309","62312","62221","62313","62260","62283","62284","62285","62289","62290","62291","62427","62249","62273","62280","62281","62254","62272","62274","150789","62415","62318","62279"],"web_cover_ids":["5712"],"type":"Song","added_by":"50304","managed_by":null}

One source states that the song \"originated about 1847 near Muskegon, Michigan\" but others have noted that no evidence is cited for this assertion.  The origin has also been placed possibly as New Brunswick or Maine. Several sources indicate that the tune is of Scottish origin under the title \"Musselburgh Fair\" but, while the Scottish origin is plausible, evidence of a tune by that name has not yet been found.

Originally it was a horse-drawn omnibus, later a tram line and ultimately replaced by the subway system.  This song originates from the horse-drawn omnibus era, circa 1840-1860.  A version called The Stage Driver published in \u201cBurnt Cork Lyrics\u201d by James Unsworth in 1859 is a blackface minstrel description of a driver who falls for a pretty young girl at a stop on Broadway. In addition to the tune, there are clear links in the opening verse to the words from Cutting Down the Pines.  The song is known to have been subject to many parodies published in songsters in the 1860s.  In later texts, the subject has shifted from the driver to the female passenger who further transforms to a seamstress thus creating a double meaning for knickerbocker.  There is also a British variant, estimated to stem from the 1860s, in which the setting is transferred to the London to Bristol railway line and the tailoress becomes a pick-pocket stealing a watch.  This was popularised in music halls and is collected as 2149 in the Roud Index of folk songs.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Cutting Down the Pines written by [Traditional]","adapted_from_id":"144518","performance_ids":["365848"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":["25129","25129"],"type":"Song","added_by":"4544","managed_by":null}

He invites a maid onto his cart and woos her on the journey.  Many of the words are taken from \"The Soor Mulk Cairt\", written by Thomas Johnstone in the 1880s for the comedian J.C. MacDonald.  That song, in Scots dialect and sung to the tune of \"The Garden Where the Praties Grow\", had been published in a Glasgow weekly periodical \"The Professional and Authors' Journal\" which printed many music-hall songs. A letter from Johnstone's daughter printed in the Weekly Scotsman newspaper on August 6, 1959, explained that her father would travel on a Sunday morning on a sour-milk cart.  Sour milk was used for baking bread and there was no urgency in its transportation.  A slow paced horse and a warm summer's morning gave the carter plenty of time for flirtation and romance, as described in the song.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"The Knickerbocker Line written by [Traditional]","adapted_from_id":"144550","performance_ids":["1591804","1591805","1591806","1589528","366294","1591807","1591808","1591812","1589529","366297","366554"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"4544","managed_by":null}
