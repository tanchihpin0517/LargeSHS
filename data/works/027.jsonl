In quite some countries versions were made available to the public on vinyl 7\"es or flexi discs. There are also various compilations comprising many versions. All are copyrighted by Coca Cola.

That adaptation used \"We'll walk hand in hand\", though, and other verses were added (see there). Nevertheless, even artists only recording the chorus credit Carawan\/Hamilton\/Seeger\/Horton (in whose names \"We Shall Overcome\" was registered) or just Seeger for the song writing. In 2016, the United States District Court in Manhattan ruled that the chorus is public domain = traditional and the additional phrases by Seeger & co. remain their work. With a higher court confirming that, the right-holders declared to from then on refrain from claiming copyrights in the melody or lyrics of any verse of the song. History: There are various theories about this song's origin. Ethnomusicologists have stated that it reflects beginning and end of the 19th-century \"No More Auction Block for Me\" spiritual, also known from its refrain as \"Many Thousands Gone\" (which Bob Dylan quotes as an influence for \"Blowing in the Wind\"). The tune is also told to have been derived from the 19th century spiritual \"I'll Be All Right\", which, again, is supposed to make use of elements from the Italian 18th century song \"Caro mio bene\" and the Latin language choral \"O sanctissima\". Although the musical and lyrical structures (not the wording) are obviously different, some also insist it was based on \"I'll Overcome Someday\", copyrighted in 1901 by Charles Albert Tindley . Others suggest the main source was the gospel \"If My Jesus Wills\", composed in the early 1930s, published in 1942 and copyrighted in 1954 by Baptist choir director Louise Shropshire (which has been supported by Pete Seeger).

The right-holders then declared to thereafter refrain from claiming copyrights in the melody or lyrics of any verse of the song. History: A protest song and key anthem of the Civil Rights Movement. An early version was first published as \"We Will Overcome\" in the September 1948 issue of the People's Songs organization's bulletin (director: Pete Seeger). The introduction was by Zilphia Horton, music director of the Highlander Folk School of Monteagle, TN, who had learned the song from CIO Food and Tobacco Workers Union members and played it a. o. to Seeger and Joe Glazer . The latter recorded it in 1950 on his album 8 New Songs for Labor , which was the first release of the song. When Guy Carawan succeeded Horton as music director at Highlander in 1959, he reintroduced it to the young (many of them teenagers) student-activists. They gave the song the words and rhythms known when singing it during brutal police raids at Highlander and subsequently being jailed. Carawan was reluctant to take credit for the song's spreading popularity, but Pete Seeger has repeatedly named him for primarily teaching and popularizing it (plus credited himself to have changed the 'will' into a \"shall'). Officially to prevent others from capitalizing on the song, Pete Seeger's manager in 1960 copyrighted \"We Shall Overcome\" (and \"We Will Overcome\") in the names of Guy Carawan, Frank Hamilton, Zilphia Horton and Pete Seeger with a 5th 'Public Domain' (= traditional) share. The resulting songwriting royalties income is said to go to the Highlander Education and Research Center, though. There are a couple of historical events connected to \"We Shall Overcome\": - In August 1963, Joan Baez led a crowd of 300,000 singing it at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington. - President Johnson, a Southerner himself, used the phrase \"We shall overcome\" in his speech to Congress on March 15, 1965, when demanding voting rights for Afro-Americans after the \"Bloody Sunday\" attacks during the Selma to Montgomery marches. - Martin Luther King recited parts of \"We Shall Overcome\" at his final sermon Sunday March 31, 1968, shortly before his assassination, and it was sung by thousands at his funeral. - It was sung by Senator Robert Kennedy, when in 1966 leading anti-apartheid crowds' choruses from the rooftop of his car in South Africa, which resulted in the song becoming an anthem of the anti apartheid movement.

The melody of \u201cGuajira Guantanamera\u201d was one of his (and his fans\u2019) favorites. Fernandez claimed to have written it at various dates (consensus puts 1929 as its year of origin). The lyrics were about a \u201ccountry girl from Guantanamo\u201d (the literal meaning of Guajira Guantanamera) who scolds her lover after she found him flirting with another woman. During the years, many other songwriters, such as Ram\u00f3n Esp\u00edgul and Herminio \"El Diablo\" Garc\u00eda Wilson, claimed they were the real authors of the song; however, it\u2019s worth mentioning that the \u201cGuajira\u201d is not just a \u201ccountry girl\u201d, but also a Cuban folk dance originating from Spain. Therefore, it is likely that Esp\u00edgul, Wilson, Fernandez, as well as many other storytellers and street performers, all took inspiration from a XIX century Cuban (or even a XVII century Spanish) traditional song for their own renditions of the Guajira Guantanamera.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["388766","538730","760782","455799","967272","1571890","879587","650477","499478","538150","431712","445575","880387","522286","519294","440563","481303","404641","558352","509200","472674","714179","656246","418441","860305","667857","404143","716493","1353398","670472","515606","1087659","507036","1290283","516409","641100","888645","865668","865667","754421","833648","592582","569113","902694","484062","545287","1052828","1282647","954418","766305"],"submission_ids":["124685","69120","69121","212867","275428"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"19","managed_by":"62883"}

There are versions with slightly differing lyrics and variations of the title, f. ex. \"Ewe Malaika\". The song has been recorded by numerous artists from all around the world and there are various translations. Always insisting on his authorship and also providing a detailed description of the circumstances under which he wrote it, Kenyan musician Fadhili William is generally recognized as the composer\/writer. His authorship has been disputed, though. Some claim the song was written by Tanzanian songwriter Adam Salim while working as a mechanic in Nairobi in 1945\/46. He is said to have written the song for his girlfriend after the parents of both disapproving their relationship. Producer Charles Worrod credits the song to Grant Charo, William's brother-in-law, who is not known to have confirmed this. Also Lucas Tututu from Mombasa claims to have written the song. In any case, William was the first to record \"Malaika\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["394191","1007369","394202","394203","394204","1452725","394201","412492","506987","1446722","1188930","1087491","409610","409611","845568","476863","409609","946555","788798","1419943","1290535","1223596","1319430","515502","630534"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"50304","managed_by":null}

Variations with altered lyrics are called \"Boggus Creek\" and \"(The) Hills of Mexico\". It is an American folk song believed to be loosely based on the pre-1830 English folk song \"Caledonia\" (also known as \"The Wearing of the Blue\" or, later, \"Canada-I-O\" and not to be confused with Caldonia ). A musicological deep research considers it a variant of John B Freeman's \"The Buffalo Song\", though. The lyrics are very similar to a broadside ballad from the 1830s describing the work of the crew of the British ship, the HMS Buffalo, when they collected timber from the kauri forests in New Zealand.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1060616","394348","1033062","1209304","1033063","394352","676088","394350","407011","982986","982420","394353","394361","438981","394354","394349","1070508","394362","394366","1554702","970001","1219700","402163","1449199","1054569","526269","394371","394370","394375","1066493","1604037","1014072","395729","394377","1107859","394381","1225704","1083054","959162","413725","1279491","1453669"],"submission_ids":["210114"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"50304","managed_by":null}
