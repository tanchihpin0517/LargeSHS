Without his daughter's knowledge, the king has the kitchen lad killed for his impertinence, usually having the boy's heart presented to his daughter.  In most versions, the king's daughter dies shortly thereafter of a broken heart. This ballad apparently comes from Guiscardo and Ghismonda's tale in Boccaccio's classic work, \"The Decameron\".

It was first collected in Sir Walter Scott's \" Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border \" (1802).   It migrated to Appalachia in the United States and was collected by Francis Child as his ballad 79.  As originally collected by Scott, the ballad was incomplete.  Thus, the song was an ideal candidate for reworking and lyrical variation. The basic story told in the ballad is of a woman who sends her three children off, in many versions to school, and the woman learns soon thereafter that the children have died.  The mother grieves and calls for her children's return.  (Some scholars contend that the wife of Usher's Well is a witch and casts a spell to bring the children back.)  The children do come back on Martinmas Day, but not as the flesh and blood the mother had desired.  The children tell their mother that they are dead and cannot stay.  The implication of the ballad is that, like the situation in the The Unquiet Grave , the children cannot rest in peace due to their mother's excessive mourning. It appears that when the ballad came to Appalachia, a new version of the ballad arose with a Christian theme.  The dead boys return on Christmas, instead of Martinmas, and they tell their mother that they are happy to return to their savior.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["400767","1047438","400766","400852","400695","400700","1288657","400763","400702","400844","460677","400724","423696","400725","400857","400855","400704","400957","936296","400764","400823","1288718","400962","400841","400963","400986","400765","401024","400964","738573","400965","522842","1029733","400968","1029732","1044837","400972","400960","1058078","400974","400978","400981","971426","400836"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

It is generally accepted that this ballad is of Scottish origin.  The earliest known published version dates to 1775, although the ballad is generally thought to have its origins in the 15th century. In the oldest form of the ballad, a stone mason builds a castle for a lord, who refuses to pay for the work.  The mason exacts his revenge by killing the lord's wife and child.  For this crime, the mason (and a nursemaid who helped him gain access to the castle) are executed.    There is considerable support for the view that the ballad is based in an actual historical incident. Most scholars seem to consider the mason's name of Lamkin to be ironic, given his vengeful crime, although the mason is variously named in the many versions of the song, including, among others,  Lambkin, Lamkin, Lincoln, Limkin, Lampkin, Lantin, and Long.  A minority view dating back to William Motherwell believes all of the various names derive from the mason's supposed true name of Lambert Linkin. In what most musicologists believe to be a later version of the ballad, Lamkin is not a mason but, rather, merely a scoundrel with no clear motive for the murders offered.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["401090","401072","401074","401073","401071","401093","401076","401094","401077","401135","401142","401139","401147","401145","401163","401160","401088"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

Thereafter it became extremely popular and was republished throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.  It became the basis of dozens of vaudeville skits.  Although Thorpe continued to write and published three volumes of poetry and several children's books, none ever achieved the attention of \"Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight\" -- her first published work. \"Hang on the Bell Nellie\" is not an adaptation of the poem as it does not use Thorpe's words, but the basic situation described in the song is the same as that in the poem.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["406980","407021","406979","407018","407012","406999","407059","407055","1082331"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}

The melody is considered an anonymous treasure of the Swedish folksong tradition and is believed to have been passed on since at least the early 1700s. It also serves as the basis for \"Risingevisan\", which is mainly sung in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, another Swedish region. Anders Fryxell wrote the known lyrics in 1822 to include the song in his musical \"Wermlandsflickan\" (The Girl from V\u00e4mland). The melody is said to have been an inspiration for Smetana when composing \"Moldau\". Furthermore, Stan Getz , when staying in Sweden in 1951, did some arranging and renamed it Dear Old Stockholm . Subsequently, it developed into a Jazz standard. Getz is therefore often credited for the (re)arrangement.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["910143","409572","569801","409582","1147058","409574","1147079","569852","814822","550995","409293","895478","981329","898044","894615","409279","478640","869850","1193644","808525","537159","635515","1318607","899119","1362152","1374705","429671","474567","1542639","677005","407847","646521","410379","637087","473319","1447421","407846","516074","1446702","688317","1477068","1516426","910566","569834","409277","407851","407886","1154033","1150450","407900","407931","416935","791027","446572","424722","1003748","407907","1003820","963773","409275","407913","808938","671421","424729","408301","443414","1452770","407945","835470","418119","1318634","593075","408262","795914","422480","652262","706588","425688","653628","553373","592886","808530","1243440","671942","1110206","1197425","631956","1513185","407854","623847","532574","450748","559262","1224173","409564","424732","409230","743883","1157736","1416095","734638","450222","1021924","702358","408299","1342887","759705","533594","1204554","409142","1592211","425143","856571","571653","434389","409146","452872","409251","821028","610590","409156","586492","548578","978316","1045107","652029","559259","437213","1132278","825100","409490","409258","947082","638212","671475","1364269","429661","598188","432353","1590188","409138","678445","537177","1048389","1051614","1365440","739839","408235","408234","638687","569906","1276960","433990","1091461","730872","453417","409178","1008871","580763","1450417","735964","433981","1112531","409239","553608","848764","481515","612124","828090","560012","1055383","1095789","409226","897491","795761","408280","418398","531641","737914","572434","751452","1085216","894394","425148","1473447","1192824","1252055","1031000","512427","1196528","1333862","1023306","848783","848775","1365486","955663","989602","1086213","939088","1186209","1241955","1238782","1305947","1512161"],"submission_ids":["267030","227807","186054","179832","174261","272049","186011","285540","168323","308864","310784","299746","301421","204080","270786","217764","183824","227657","175673","194672","217724","214767","280922"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"50304","managed_by":null}

Consisting of five parts, Gershwin intended to reflect the moods he had felt during his stays in Paris. \"An American in Paris\" was commissioned by conductor Walter Damrosch and is composed for a symphonic orchestra plus saxophone and automobile horns. The work premiered on December 13, 1928, at the Carnegie Hall, with Damrosch conducting the New York Philharmonic. Loosely based on a melody named \"Very Parisienne\" Gershwin had written in 1926, \"An American in Paris\" was revised by Gershwins publisher Frank Campbell-Watson (1898\u20131980), leading to the version commonly performed. Campbell-Watson's arrangements are the reason why the work is not public domain, yet, although Gershwin passed away in 1937. The 'rhapsodic ballet' (Gershwin) was the inspiration for the movie of the same name (1951). The original version, missing Campbell-Watson's changes and including the 120 bars Damrosch had skipped, was premiered on Dec. 14th, 2015 by Bremer Philharmoniker.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["408061","1488409","584658","760853","522873","523053","1578485","1451030","1479209","419958","1246751","844339","1605425","1360094","614910","937514","1154374","994261","501004","1100487","907516","850391","1414182","1187926","674368","1154067","514477","546301","1022820","1204281","1155871","509027","548437","1357297"],"submission_ids":["242449","291224","277739","124855"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"50304","managed_by":null}

During World War II, Trinidad was garrisoned by American troops, who were there to defend the island from German attack.  \"Rum and Coca-Cola\"  referred to the preferred drink of American servicemen on the island and was written by Grant, known under the pseudonym \"Lord Invader\".  The song was popular with both the locals and the U.S. servicemen and was widely performed at clubs and bars on the island. After the song was already a phenomenon in Trinidad, Amsterdam came to the island to perform as a comic in a USO show for American servicemen.  Amsterdam was on the island for over a month, and when he returned to the United States, he copyrighted \"Rum and Coca-Cola\".  The lyrics he copyrighted were very similar to those that appeared as Lord Invader's work as they appeared in a booklet entitled \"Victory Calypsoes - 1943\".  Amsterdam had sanitized the lyrics somewhat so the song could get radio airplay in the United States, playing down, but not entirely eliminating, the theme of American servicemen's exploitation of local women through prostitution.  There are now many lyrical variants of the song. Amsterdam told a nightclub singer, Jeri Sullavan, who was looking for new material about the song.  Sullavan, with an arranger, Paul Baron, entered in an agreement with Leo Feist, Inc., to publish the song.  Before the publication, Amsterdam attempted to copyright the song in his own name, Sullavan threatened to sue, and Feist pressured Amsterdam to add Baron and Sullavan to the copyright. After the Andrews Sisters' had a hit with the song, Amsterdam was sued separately for infringement of the lyrics and the music.  Amsterdam lost both suits, but ultimately bought the copyright.  In fact, Bellasco's music was apparently based on a folk tune from Martinique, but he nonetheless prevailed in his suit against Amsterdam. Amsterdam stuck with his claim that he had written the song throughout the remainder of his life.  Louis Nizer represented the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, and his account of the same can be read in his book, \"My Life in Court\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"L'ann\u00e9e pass\u00e9e written by Lionel Belasco","adapted_from_id":"149879","performance_ids":["408890","409094","408899","409068","408917","408921","409134","409087","408934","408930","409930","409047","410915","833755","722944","409171","408933","409186","408935","945558","409928","409187","409100","261119","1101780","409133","409177","1328940","475603","409191","804469","410954","929201","486628","666834","602502","672898","1212425","1556823","1308353","642113","738707","409057","408937","831098","941075","409135","442772","1428347","1199617","497766","1411324","1079160","1241045"],"submission_ids":["274743","141576","173421"],"web_cover_ids":["2641","2641","2646","2646","2642","2642","2643","2643","2645","2645"],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":"2"}

He copyrighted a song he called \"Lubly Fan Will You Come Out Tonight?\" in 1844, which used the melody now commonly associated with \"Buffalo Gals\".  This tune has been traced back in published form to 1839, where it appears in a collection of dance tunes entitled \"Virginia Reels, Selected and Arranged for the Piano Forte\" as \"Midnight Serenade\" so Cool White's tune was not original with him.  At least one scholar has suggested that \"Buffalo Gals\" was inspired by the English singing game, \"Pray, Pretty Miss\". In 1845 another blackface minstrel group, The Ethiopian Serenaders\"  published sheet music for \"Philadelphia Gals\", which had the typical set of \"Buffalo Gals\" lyrics, except substituting \"Philadelphia\" for \"Buffalo\".  In 1848, The Ethiopian Serenaders published another version of this song as \"Buffalo Gals\".  In neither case did The Ethiopian Serenaders attribute an author to either the tune or the lyrics.  Edward Christy, the leader of perhaps the most popular blackface minstrel group, Christy's Minstrels, did obtain a copyright on the music and lyrics to \"Buffalo Gals\" in 1848, although both tune and at least substantially similar lyrics predated the copyright. Fiddlin' John Carson recorded the song in 1924 as \"Alabama Gal (Won't You Come Out Tonight?)\".  Also can be performed as \"Round Town Girls (or Gals)\" instead of \"Buffalo Girls (or Gals)\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["960228","1239922","1037164","1239785","1021623","410734","1070788","1096798","410735","1096756","1011581","1398977","410739","1054033","1353891","960251","1023727","491167","445458","410843","410893","1040379","632162","410853","1094715","410938","1046241","1321449","491454","1109267","410939","937974","410881","459447","517715","960291","1056734","863111","1043363","628342","1425702","1404637","1574412","410736","1037172","1552411","1020833","1350882","935300","1592577","410836","1006349","1012151","1102320","1019965","1102343","975696","1089559","1083237","410885","410740","410884","1051296","1212044","1094967","1090990","1059933","1021237","1020598","410828","1238258","902305","410865","1094824","1042681","1385218","1391389","1014905","410889","410861","1028654","1047726","1095315","1025508","1093318","1050755","1096945","1040911","1041558","1029075","482682","1036975","1063002","1065780","1098109","1077658"],"submission_ids":["259583","258499","283647","304962"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}
