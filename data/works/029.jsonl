McClintock is known to have sung the song no later than early 1898.  What seems to make McClintock's authorship \"questionable\" to many is that he would have only been 15 years old when the song was written.  McClintock, however, had run away from home at age 14, and hoboed to New Orleans where he had his first experiences with the type of men that are the subject of this song.  While age 15 is young for a songwriter, it is by no means outlandishly young. Bud L. McKillips, who was a journalist for labor publications,  contends that the words were written by an unknown member of the International Workers of the World (\"IWW\").  From its inception in1905, McClintock had himself been a dedicated Wobbly.  During demonstrations in Spokane, Washington in 1906, the Wobblies, who were often drowned out by Salvation Army Bands sent in by business managements, adopted the strategy of writing parody lyrics to the tunes sung by the Salvation Army.  McClintock was, in fact, part of the IWW songwriting team so it is far from inconceivable that he is the Wobbly who wrote this song. Others credit a Kansas City hobo, \"One Finger Ellis\" for writing some or all of the verses to \"Hallelujah, I'm a Bum\" while in jail.  It is certainly possible that such an individual wrote additional verses to the song as it was a common occurrence for new verses to be written for true folksongs. Although not truly a folksong, it is collected as number 7992 in the Roud Folk Song Index.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Thine the Glory written by John J.

Luke Gordon and Jimmie Skinner quickly covered the song in a more Hank Williams-style set more closely to the tune of the traditional Appalachian song East Virginia . Their versions had much wider distribution and have been covered by countless others, including The Grateful Dead.  Many of the bluegrass versions of \"Dark Hollow\" incorporate some of the verses from the \"East Virginia\" family of songs and are harder to classify.  Browning's original song had very simple lyrics - he essentially copied the first verse of lyrics from Buell Kazee's 1927 \"East Virginia\" and Clarence Ashley's 1929 song \"Dark Holler Blues\" (which itself was a derivative of \"East Virginia\") that said \"I'd rather be in some dark holler where the sun don't ever shine....\".  Because of the similarities to the \"East Virginia\" family of songs SHS is setting this up as an adaptation.  Browning's \"Dark Hollow\" lyrics: I'd rather be in some dark hollow, Where the sun don't never shine, Than to be at home alone just knowing that she's gone, That would cause me to lose my mind CHO: So pray train blows your whistle, Take me far on down the track I'm going away, I'm leaving today, I'm going but I ain't coming back","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"East Virginia written by [Traditional]","adapted_from_id":"99974","performance_ids":["1020583","15109","15108","1079956","931710","1020584","1020585","15110","1051043","48310","923560","15111","1330969","781693","1116145","430403","1573252","559126","1067500","15112","435498","1454461","1029797","308268","1085883","434133","1592683","1517035","930312","975068","839118","125348","1243450","1110777","513899","1516531","490682","1081634","1030772"],"submission_ids":["302720"],"web_cover_ids":["10739"],"type":"Song","added_by":"7","managed_by":"99660"}

Researchers have found several possible origins of this tune based on the lives of real Joe Clarks in Virginia, Kentucky & Maryland. Old Joe Clark may even have started out as a ballad which then later became a popular fiddle tune, instead of the lyrics being added to an already existing fiddle tune. Others suggest it first circulated in children's tradition and in play-parties and later was introduced into the fiddle and banjo world.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["431737","431717","431780","1027524","939949","431786","977221","431744","431756","431749","431778","431769","293651","1011526","1054919","1096050","1049926","1052639","436266","1019848","1053575","782592","938193","1105724","1014794","1053879","431770","572439","1045235","974441","462639","1052777","479887","1065312","781649","943085","928399","1038292","834116","727462","1098511","1048325","935410","1067495","507635","489524","675318","489486","984083","942273","1039083","1028324","1557848","1071592","869866","729029","1084619","793028","773480","438948","435507","1019055","943542","1090531","1110313","1094055","1029070","1069104","1083171","1041238","789773","1074878","902047","431726","1018513","1011531","572957","1019547","1141854","1029805","1346026","939758","1099845","1103132","1019570","799573","748071","982274","975706","1102481","1102324","1048932","1021528","908667","888516","1448356","595244","923589","927548","1433331","1031469","927501","1075741","1179510","966393","1080439","1094830","1038249","1065854","1059908","1021237","1486461","1044029","1043220","1506623","964603","1042867","1077568","1092867","462584","1114664","1089595","1557739","966822","946765","1030568","979664","1090911","1026356","1576824","934114","1028651","1169996","1087961","1056257","975155","1016437","1025148","1027107","1065413","1321320","1050751","431711","1032632","973899","1561172","1057573","932237","1030624","1030704","1030680","1055794","1030641","1056092","572676","482681","1017446","1065568","1074542","1097857","1063773","685748","1083079","1081626","1336149"],"submission_ids":["177693","239843","203783","110239","165315"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"6487","managed_by":null}
