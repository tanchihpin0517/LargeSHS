There is also a pop music variant called Mockingbird sung distinctly differently with lyrics beginning, \"Mock (yeah) \/ Ing (yeah) \/ Bird (yeah) \/ Yeah (yeah) \/ Mockin'bird..\" and a completely different tune. However, some performances called \"Mockingbird\" are just covers of \"Hush Little Baby\". Hush, little baby, don't say a word Mama's going to buy you a mockingbird And if that mockingbird won't sing Mama's going to buy you a diamond ring And if that diamond ring turns brass Mama's going to buy you a looking glass And if that looking glass gets broke Mama's going to buy you a billy goat A version published in the July 17, 1914 issue of 'The Osceola Times\" (Oceola, Arkansas) described a version as a slumber song sung on the old Alabama plantations.
