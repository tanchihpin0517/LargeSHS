Danks ultimately sent Rexford a check for $18.00, implying that he accepted six of the nine sets of lyrics, but provided no specification as to which lyrics he was purchasing.  The song became extremely popular, selling two million copies as sheet music beginning in 1873 and another one million copies, when the song was revived in 1907.

The piece with the new lyrics was extremely popular, resulting in over one million sheet music sales.  Lemare threatened to sue the lyricists in 1925, resulting in a settlement in which Lemare received royalties for sales of \"Moonlight and Roses\".  As Lemare had merely been paid a small flat sum for the melody when it had been copyrighted in 1892, he finally made some real money from his work.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["457279","1144035","505116","457535","458360","921893","1559008","1340253","457540","457447","457457","1521783","488779","457454","457972","457644","458036","1585571","457903","1566880","1513277","1301712","826796","1230477","1268655","1080329","1302102","1427324","1324790","458129","955722","564870","1056302","915801","458193","1353995","1421686","505616","458097","1584021","1398825","457833","458221","458091","1132305","827501","457666","458322","1386704","1264971","458235","835139","458106","1320856","1217231","458262","1108486","458205","1254495","458048","458199","484064","458267","1248634","1373430","458116","1251514","1123235","1302857","458331","1255179","1214985","1119154"],"submission_ids":["278298","263892","248269"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":"62883"}

(Several references incorrectly state that the song was revised after the sinking of the USS Maine in 1898).  Although frequently called a song of the American Civil War, the work actually post-dates that war and is more accurately associated with the Spanish-American War.  The song's popularity was renewed during World War I. We have been unable to ascertain the first released or recorded version of the work due to a lack of available precise data.  Despite the listed release dates, it is possible that any of the versions of this work shown as released in the 1890s could be the first released version.  Recording information about these early releases is even harder to obtain.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["463428","463392","463385","463426","463430","463382","463431","463432","1455592","1455734","1486752","716677","463739","1403115"],"submission_ids":["74332"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":null}
