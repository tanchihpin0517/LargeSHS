An early version is found in Anne Virginia Culbertson's collection of folk tales, \"At the Big House, where Aunt Nancy and Aunt 'Phrony Held Forth on the Animal Folks\" (Bobbs-Merrill, 1904). There are various versions and adaptations. Original first verse and refrain: I'se gwine down ter Richmond I'll tell you w'a hit's for: I'se gwine down ter Richmond Fer ter try an' end dis war An'-a you good-by, Cindy, Cindy Good-by, Cindy Ann An'-a you good-by, Cindy, Cindy I'se gwine ter Rappahan As with many folk songs, each singer was free to add verses, and many did. In addition, as Byron Arnold and Bob Halli noted in An Alabama Songbook, performers could swap verses with those of other songs, including \"Old Joe Clark\" and \"Boil Them Cabbage Down\" Modern first verse and refrain - You ought to see my Cindy She lives way down South And she's so sweet the honey bees All swarm around her mouth Get along home Cindy, Cindy Get along home Cindy, Cindy Get along home Cindy, Cindy I'll marry you some day","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"The Gospel Train (Get on Board) written by [Traditional]","adapted_from_id":"126410","performance_ids":["1066050","582955","583153","1092370","1048736","583126","583133","582957","961603","582656","1033698","883827","782178","1054246","1052638","1054043","1032709","470481","724986","1013922","982475","1067205","1107680","1490836","1040565","1049434","1509739","1053043","961619","947913","748241","1097293","1016405","1088439","1401800","1383990","1021658","1071579","1086733","1094240","653370","470445","1089416","1052429","1561175","1058221","969323","496725","600859","1097616","1076627","961621","1029084","470443","1093668","1065194","961468","470439"],"submission_ids":["110245","115873"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"50304","managed_by":null}
