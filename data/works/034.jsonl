He said 'I like the song \"Begin the Beguine\". I like the melody but I'd like to put new lyrics on it.' So I sat down and wrote new lyrics for it. Then when it came time to record it, Cole Porter said, 'Hell no!' (laughs) He said 'What are you talking about? You want to change the lyrics to my song?' So I changed the melody. The song only had two chords, C and F. Charlie Hodge is the one that recommened that I do it with two chords and give it a kind of beat. I gave him credit as a third writer on the song just for that. Elvis is credited on the song; it was just more his suggestion to do it. Elvis never really tried to write songs.

This version of \"The Leaving of Liverpool\" was collected from Richard Maitland, a retired sea captain living in New York, whom Doerflinger had recorded at Sailors' Snug Harbor in Staten Island from 1938 to 1940.  Maitland told how he learned it in 1885 while on the ship General Knox: \"I was on deck one night, when I heard a Liverpool man singin' it in the fo'c'sle ... Yes sir, that song hit the spot!\" The song tells of a voyage in the David Crockett, a clipper ship that visited Liverpool under the command of Captain John A Burgess of Massachusetts, which dates it to some time in the period 1863 to 1874. It is #9435 in the Roud Folk Song Index. Another version of \"The Leaving of Liverpool\" (not the subject of popular recordings but possibly with an older history) was collected by Doerflinger in early 1942 from a retired sailor named Patrick Tayluer, who was living at the Seamen's Church Institute at the South Street Seaport in Manhattan. While sharing common elements, including the words and tune of the chorus, the shanty told a different tale that is speculated to relate to Californian goldrush voyages (from 1849).","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["498722","498727","498729","498733","498731","498732","498750","498749","498737","1236706","498767","1325327","498838","498890","1085353","498758","499186","1016472","834111","498809","541797","498740","498754","967091","1068343","499209","1541772","498842","498792","502497","515004","552774","879730","1067852","498741","1270406","906707","498744","1064566","498746","498795","498747","1375657","498892","1197735","597914","992062","1074000","425233","530540"],"submission_ids":["257471","247244"],"web_cover_ids":["9157"],"type":"Song","added_by":"4544","managed_by":null}

The chorus he added references the  Jacob Epstein \"Liverpool Resurgent\" statue of a nude man outside Lewis's department store and the city's second cathedral that was still under construction at the time the song was written.  Such was the song's popularity in local clubs during the 1960s folk revival that it has been mistaken as a traditional song.  In fact, it has since become part of the oral folk tradition, with many anonymous additional or alternative verses in circulation. McGovern too updated his verses.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Strawberry Roan written by Curly Fletcher , J.E.

Kittredge of New Hampshire was a professional singer and wrote this song after receiving a draft notice in 1863. Due to a childhood medical illness, Kittredge was not actually inducted into the Union Army, although this song became very popular among Union Army enlisted men (it was also sung by Confederate soldiers). Kittredge offered the song to the Boston publisher Oliver Ditson & Co. for $15.00, which initially rejected the work as too sad and sentimental. Asa Hutchinson, a member of The Hutchinson Family Singers and friend of Kittredge, was convinced that the song would be successful, and Hutchinson proved successful in getting Ditson & Co. to publish the work. Ditson agreed to pay a royalty of two-and-one-half cents for each copy of the song sold. Hutchinson and Kittredge split the royalties evenly and within two years, each man had made a thousand dollars in royalties.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["503188","503310","1069563","503321","503323","503322","503336","503362","503359","1069372","1235741","532088","503427","1054603","503990","555714","1016518","555712","503482","503402","503498","1072141","1050794","503487","555723","1105002","503459","503437","1070194","503300","503494","503493","532073","503379","1029048","555711","1319445","532107","503429","503444","880921"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3024","managed_by":"78739"}
