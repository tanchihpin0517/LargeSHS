Its age is undetermined.  The publication date above refers to its first known appearance in print, in Thomas Walker's \"The Quaker's Opera -  As It Is Perform'd at Lee's and Harper's Great Theatrical Booth in Bartholomew-Fair - With the Musick Prefix'd to Each Song\".  The tune, which is titled Air XX: Country Garden, is played in Act III carrying a song by Walker called \"O Goodman Roger, Hold Your Tongue\" in which the character Mrs. Coaxthief scolds her husband. The tune was collected separately by Cecil Sharp in 1906 from William \"Merry\" Kimber , concertina player for the Headington Quarry Morris, with a three line lyric noted in Sharp's field notes.  Sharp later passed the tune to Percy Grainger , whose piano arrangement was first published by Schirmer in 1918.  In the 1950s, Grainger also arranged the melody for woodwind and full orchestra. Until his death in 1961, Country Gardens sheet music sales generated a great proportion of Grainger's income. In a letter to Sharp he wrote:  \"It has proven even more of a success than I had expected, and you will see from the enclosed photocopy that it has broken Schirmer's sales records. I hope you will forgive me if I ask you once again if you will consider sharing the royalty with me.

Rubinstein later repudiated his previous accusations and became a fervent champion of the work. It is one of the most popular of Tchaikovsky's compositions and among the best known of all piano concertos. it was used as the theme to Orson Welles's famous radio series \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" and it came to be associated with Welles throughout his career.

As such, she is often mistakenly credited as the author of \"Boston Burglar\". There's an American variant called the Louisville Burglar that tells the same tale but changes the locale.
