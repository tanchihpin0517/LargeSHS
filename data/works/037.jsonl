Kindt published sheet music for his 1904 \"Wabash Cannon Ball\", but it is likely that his revised lyrics of the 1882 song The Great Rock Island Route!! were written by unknown authors prior to 1904.  The Carter Family made one of the earlier recordings of this new song and A.P. Carter registered it as his own (which he often did), so today most people incorrectly attribute this song to him.  Roy Acuff's 1938 version sold over ten million records. From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore She climbs a flowery mountains o'er the hills and by the shore She's mighty tall and handsome she's known quite well by all She's a regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say She's from Tennessee she's long and she's tall She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball Here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand And always be remembered in the courts throughout the land His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall We'll carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"The Great Rock Island Route!! written by J.

Elements of some versions of the song suggest that it dates from at least the mid-18th century. The Curragh of Kildare speaks of the actual Curragh, which is a large area of common land in Kildare, Ireland, used to rally the Irish Army. The history of the text is quite complicated. Versions have been taken down at different times in Ireland by collectors like Petrie and Joyce. The song has also been collected in Scotland and even in England; the singer Frank Purslow collected a version (The Winter's Gone and Past) in Dorset. Petrie was of the opinion that it was an \"old Anglo-Irish song\" and argued that the Scottish versions were most likely developed from it. Several printed ballad versions exist, under titles such as The Lamenting Maid. The most well-known version of the text, usually referred to by the title The Winter it is Past, is attributed to Robert Burns [1759-1796] who re-wrote the original of this song as a poem, The Winter It Is Past, in 1788 (Poems and Songs of Robert Burns. The Harvard Classics, 1909-1914). Burns appears to have developed it from a popular stall-ballad, The Lovesick Maid, which referred to a highwayman called Johnson, who was hanged in 1750 for robbery in the Curragh. Burns polished the original text considerably and removed two stanzas referring directly to Johnson. The resulting ballad was published in the collection of the Scots Musical Museum. A variant was collected by Maud Karpeles [1885-1976] and published as The Winter's Gone And Past, #54 in Folk Songs From Newfoundland (Faber and Faber, Oxford, 1934; London, 1971). Different airs have been used for the song. Petrie suspected that one had been composed expressly for the stall-ballad, probably in Scotland around 1750, but expressed an opinion that \"the same song united to a melody unquestionably Irish has been [...] known in Ireland [...] for an equal or much longer period\". The tune used for Burns' version has been identified as a (distant) relative of that used for the American ballad Fare You Well, My Own True Love.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1597132","1597131","545045","1418511","1035602","1492209","906717","1408500","543489","1289087","1597129","792559","671690","545046","1594735"],"submission_ids":["257641","257614"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":"99660"}

The waltz accompanied a sequence in which a woman rises from her deathbed to dance with ghosts. In 1904 Sibelius revised the piece for a performance in Helsinki on 25 April where it was presented as \"Valse triste\".

The origins of the song are unclear and there is no historical lineage. It is most likely a merging of a number of songs. It has been traced to an Irish-language song, \"Do bh\u00ed bean uasal\" (\"There Was a Noblewoman\"), which is attributed to the poet Cathal Bu\u00ed Mac Giolla Ghunna, who died in 1745 in County Clare. The song appears on a ballad sheet in Cork City in the mid nineteenth century. Other sources suggest Carrickfergus may have evolved from at least two separate songs. For example, the \u201cAncient Music of Ireland\u201d published by George Petrie in 1855 contained a song called \"The Young Lady\" which featured many but not all of the lyrics used in Carrickfergus. Gogan also refers to a recording of a song called \"Sweet Maggie Gordon\" published by Mrs Pauline Lieder in New York in 1880. It contains verses which are similar to Carrickfergus but the chorus is closer to another Irish\/Scottish folk song called \"Peggy Gordon\". It has also been claimed that that the song first appeared as a ballad also known as \u201cThe Young Sick Lover\u201d, published in 1830 but with perhaps earlier origins. Also closely related is another traditional song, \"The Water is Wide\", which has a similar tune and very similar lyrics in some lines. In modern times, legend is that \"Carrickfergus\" became known to Irish folk singer Dominic Behan after actor Peter O'Toole related it to him. It has since been reported that O\u2019Toole first heard the song in 1946. However the song that he recorded was a hybrid between the song he knew and a longer version relayed to him by his friend Richard Harris in 1957. Behan put it in print and made recordings in the 1960s, under the titles \u201cThe Kerry Boat Song\u201d and \u201cThe Kerry Boatman\u201d. The middle verse was allegedly written by Behan.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1030159","1089721","1287905","818976","1073045","1159170","545065","1068102","1406880","1005110","1320660","963525","563115","564029","963566","1589386","1251682","1005828","1286989","1606857","1510099","1336922","1460583","991961","1582903","965340","895632","1198633","963175","638719","1289250","971517","545066","579034","1012242","981689","1311709","967945","911515","638717","545064","607863","871125","1561423","1469216","1163117","1030189","963375","1403290","1592939","1103791","1594726","963429","1161220","1594757","1606555","1266483","848441","1124029","1383707","1264461","1510095"],"submission_ids":["185830","259668","259563","185836","259493","314914","185822","185841","91912","185840","185839","185828","265835","190250","283698","120121","185845"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":"99660"}
