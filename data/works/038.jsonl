The song has a somewhat complicated story. It was originally written as a poem in 1960, published in Arbeiderbladet that year. The same year, Bj\u00f8rn Amdahl wrote the melody for the song. Pr\u00f8ysen recorded this for NRK (Norwegian radio) in 1963, but never released a version of the song himself. The melody was otherwise mostly unknown for the public, and when it was first published in \"Alf Pr\u00f8ysens verker - Samlede viser og vers\" the composer is written as \"Unknown\".  10th August 1968, the title \"Vise for g\u00e6rne jinter\" appeared when lyrics were published again in Arbeiderbladet. Amdahl and Pr\u00f8ysen had a deal that no other composers could write a melody for the Pr\u00f8ysen songs that Amdahl composed, but since it apparently was an unknown composer, Egil Monn-Iversen wrote a melody for the song in 1974 for the play \"Kj\u00e6m du i kveld\".  This melody has become the standard version of the song, and the first version that was released on record, as an instrumental in 1979. A third melody was written by Per Hommelhaug.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["548240"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"58377","managed_by":null}

Behrens' \"Skole-Sangbog indeholdende to- tre- og firestemmige Sange. F\u00f8rste Hefte, 40 tostemmige Sange for Sopran og Alt, eller Tenor og Bas 2\". It is not known which of them were first. The song was published in two Danish school song books before that, the fifth nuber of A.P. Berggreen's \"Sange til Skolebrug\" (1844) and the Erslevs brothers' \"Haandbog ved Sangunderviisningen i Skoler\" (1845). Both of these had four stanzas of Overbeck's lyrics translated to Danish. Lindeman published a more or less unchanged Danish lyric, while Behrens translated some of the lines to Norwegian.

The de facto national anthem of Norway from 1820 until the early 20th century. From the mid-1860s, \"Ja, vi elsker dette landet\" gradually came to occupy the unofficial position as national anthem, but was used alongside \"S\u00f8nner av Norge\" until the early 20th century, with \"S\u00f8nner av Norge\" being preferred in official situations. The anthem was written after Det Kongelige Selskap for Norges Vel had announced a competition to write a national anthem for Norway in 1819.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["550054","550086","550089","550092","550099","550096","550124","550208"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"58377","managed_by":null}
