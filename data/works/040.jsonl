Around 1653 Paul Gerhardt wrote a German version which is known by its incipit \"O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden\". This German translation was first published in the 1656 edition of Johann Cr\u00fcgers Praxis Pietatis Melica. The music for the German and English versions of the hymn is by Hans Leo Hassler written around 1600 for a secular love song \"Mein G'm\u00fct ist mir verwirret\", which first appeared in print in the 1601 Lustgarten Neuer Teutscher Ges\u00e4ng. The tune was appropriated and rhythmically simplified for Gerhardt's German hymn in 1656 by the same Johann Cr\u00fcger. Johann Sebastian Bach arranged the melody and used five stanzas of the hymn in his Matth\u00e4us-Passion (St Matthew Passion).","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["944871","569996","972436","1070064"],"submission_ids":["293779"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Classical work","added_by":"52961","managed_by":null}

There are two melodies existing for the lyrics. The first one was composed by Ludvig M. Lindemann, and is the one most used today, and the other has the same melody as \"Dei vil alltid klaga og kyta\", that Aasen preferred.

It was premiered at the Teatro Eldorado in Barcelona, September 1914, initially to little success, despite the singer Mary Focela performing it every day for a month. The piece was later reintroduced in the same theater, this time sung by Raquel Meller , who after analyzing the text and music observed a contradiction in the pasodoble: the music was cheerful, but the lyrics were sad. For this reason she decided to dress in all black with a wide mantilla (Spanish headscarf), demanding sole focus on her with the orchestra playing at low intensity. Meller also rearranged the song, reciting the second stanza over the music instead of singing it. The arrangement was unheard of until then, and resulted in a huge success.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1273205","1408645","1069295","1349903","1547193","1408621","574933","583001","1502882","1557495","951623","1555442","1557493","1010735","1582163","1196460","750861","1203422","1525113","1146330","1423267","1428866","1452470","1350726","1007705","1385719","951621","791686","1493139","818290","1430585","1413840","1349912","1368570","1320172","1409510","717256","1566769","1345796","1557570","1139649","1068899","703855","1165877","1311904","873713","1402278","1173952","1003904","1235728","1563045","1010493","1319889","587211","1235406"],"submission_ids":["151004","126598","248133","238057","249049","248964","248132","150997","150994","249054","249047","126568","126597"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"58237","managed_by":null}

The Transformers Theme is a song composed and written by Ford Kinder and Anne Bryant that was originally used in The Transformers television series and Hasbro's commercials. The opening for Seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4 of The Transformers all shared the same lyrics but different backing music. Season 1 and 2 both shared the same unique instrumental for the end credits (also used by Omni Productions as the ending theme to Transformers: The Headmasters, Transformers Super-God Masterforce and Transformers Victory) but both Season 3 and 4 just used the instrumental for their opening which famously contained a chorus of \"Ah-ah\" chants. Verses were added in the version performed by Lion that was used as the ending to The Transformers: The Movie, this full version was later covered in 2007 by Blacklab (replacing \"Unicron\" in the first verse for \"Megatron\", as he was the antagonist of the 2007 film). Part of the instrumental used during the \"More Than Meets The Eye\" and \"Robots in Disguise\" lines has been extensively used as the scene transition music even in series that do not feature the full theme.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["575774","575775","972017"],"submission_ids":["143417"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":"62883"}

Believed to have been written in 1771 during Goethe's stay in Strasbourg when he was in love with Friederike Brion, to whom the poem is addressed. The episode is the inspiration for Franz Leh\u00e1r 1928 operetta Friederike, which includes Leh\u00e1r's setting Sah ein Knab' ein R\u00f6slein stehn . But a different genesis of Goethe's poem is more plausible German scholars have uncovered a number of variants that were circulating in the 1770's. Apart from a distant ancestor in 1602, these variants are all associated with Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803), another of the great names of German literature.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":[],"submission_ids":["233304","202251","201270","198990","233013","232062","233036","234727","233171","198640","232669","233206","232937","198636","233412","202056"],"web_cover_ids":["21481","21481","21478","21478","21471","21471","21533","21533","21467","21467","22780","22780","22748","22748","22779","22779","21501","21501","21535","21535","21536","21536"],"type":"Poem","added_by":"52961","managed_by":null}
