The song narrates the story of an itinerant worker, or \"swagman\", making a drink of billy tea at a bush camp and capturing a stray jumbuck (sheep) to eat. When the jumbuck's owner, a squatter (landowner), and three mounted policemen pursue the swagman for theft, he declares \"You'll never catch me alive!\" and commits suicide by drowning himself in a nearby billabong (watering hole), after which his ghost haunts the site. The original lyrics were written in 1895 by Australian poet Banjo Paterson, and were first published as sheet music in 1903. The Australian poet Banjo Paterson wrote the words to \"Waltzing Matilda\" in January 1895 while staying at Dagworth Station, a sheep and cattle station near Winton in Central West Queensland owned by the Macpherson family. The words were written to a tune played on a zither or autoharp by 31\u2011year\u2011old Christina Macpherson, one of the family members at the station. Macpherson had heard the tune \"The Craigielee March\" played by a military band while attending the Warrnambool steeplechase horse racing in Victoria in April 1894, and played it back by ear at Dagworth. Paterson decided that the music would be a good piece to set lyrics to, and produced the original version during the rest of his stay at the station and in Winton.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["581271","860646","1230647","772441","1001202","1442264","860536","777184","1335789","962882","1037733","1332385","952011","742318","1374167","600119","660814","248404","1012488","1452322","915310","586726","582703","906961","989585","581263","1392579","681038","1287470","623000","584209","624666","1331350","1223448","1038719","1581323","1291253","1265489","742262","989598","851934","1348097","1332203","852110","591668","1484322","860371","1196698","1230861","1392597","1330174","1192017","1110611","1353257","851948","1420789","838411","1038806","872076","1230808","1290465","874907","1084694","781614","911545","1459181","704906","654962","1067822","1225386","1038799","1291286","762101","1183607","979112","690050","1443504","796675","1230382","1402188","1348783","963443","513838","802071","1408365","1146090","583318","1026883","1507799","1526348","1538890","1384276","1230811","1230807","762099","785794","1290918","1469774"],"submission_ids":["298095","298035","156934","243833","261841","206032","275059","298039","68770","298066","150204","298033","298064","228144","184102","260646","298069","298060","298067","297912","276722","298042","298043","298058","298048","298068"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}

Sung as \"God Save the Queen\" or \"God Save the King\", depending on the monarch. The first original title was \"God Save the King\", as the monarch was King George II. The author of the tune is unknown and it may originate in plainchant, but a 1619 attribution to John Bull is sometimes made.  Beyond its first verse, which is consistent, \"God Save the Queen\/King\" has many historic and extant versions. Since its first publication, different verses have been added and taken away and, even today, different publications include various selections of verses in various orders. The first published version of what is almost the present tune appeared in 1744 in Thesaurus Musicus. The 1744 version of the song was popularised in Scotland and England the following year, with the landing of Charles Edward Stuart and was published in The Gentleman's Magazine.  This manuscript has the tune depart from that which is used today at several points, one as early as the first bar, but is otherwise clearly a strong relative of the contemporary anthem.

The song's first known public performance was in Henry J. Sayers' 1891 revue \"Tuxedo\", which was performed in Boston, Massachusetts. The song became widely known in the version sung by Lottie Collins in London music halls in 1892. The melody was later used in various contexts, including as the theme song to the television show \"Howdy Doody\". The song's authorship is disputed. It was originally credited to Henry J. Sayers, who was the manager of Rich and Harris, a producer of the George Thatcher Minstrels. Working class hero Joe Hill later set new lyrics to the song lyrics making it a unions classic.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1055606","1402238","587296","950836","936364","587302","1237293","588861","587301","1228126","1535590","589749","1015945","1027225","1462345","1201192","1153405","1264779"],"submission_ids":["223655"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}
