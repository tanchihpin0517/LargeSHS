It was written in 1911 by Byron D. Stokes (Albion, Class of 1913) and F. Dudleigh Vernor (Albion, Class of 1914). Stokes had written the words while in class one June day that year and presented them that afternoon to Vernor, who was practicing the piano in a local house and composed the music at that time. The song has since become a favorite among ballroom orchestras and was used in two movie musicals of the same name, in 1933 and 1946.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1427378","1427421","1427291","1427538","1427440","1427285","1046885","1427518","592854","1427503","1427290","1427287","1427426","1427407","1427438","1427489","1427425","1427248","1427550","820528","592856","592852","1419396","1208408","1427454","1427293","1164201","1427389","1427548","1050586","1427532","1435952","1427648","1427652","1427650","1427470","1427696","1427727","1427672","1427739","874016","1250455","1427720","875028","1427433","1427484","873193","1427412","686488","1428039","1098908","1428057","1427522","1421488","1428076","1506963","1428159","1581561","1427500","1427491","1427506","908864","1427513","1427496","667564","1427647","1427498","1552410","1427428","1427660","1427782","880562","592850","1427303","1427667","1160284","1244580","1427759","1383945","1427316","1454109","1427703","1427675","1150416","640257","1428008","687475","885195","1400921","1428030","874186","1428048","679194","1584003","873196","1237330","1428091","1428150","1428131","1237374","1169530","1268250","930852","1249030","1151488"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"52961","managed_by":null}

According to Luigi Lopez, the song was composed in 1975 and its lyrics were solely written by Carla Vistarini. The song was then given to Gabriella Ferri , who was reportedly very happy about it. For some reason, Califano was asked to adapt the lyrics to a male perspective, but the final result was so different from the original that the authors presumably vetoed his version and eventually shelved the song. Many years later, \"La nevicata del '56\" was given to Mia Martini, who only used one line from Califano's lyrics. On the other hand, Mia Martini said that she asked Califano for more than one change, so that the original love song became a song about childhood dreams: \"I was eight in 1956, I couldn't possibly fall in love\", she explained. The title of the song refers to a historic event: the \"1956 snowfall\" is still remember in Rome as one of the most exceptional meteorological events in recent history.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["592862"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"19","managed_by":null}
