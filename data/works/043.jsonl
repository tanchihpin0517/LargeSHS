It is sung in the Yorkshire dialect, and is considered the unofficial anthem of Yorkshire.  According to tradition, the words were composed by members of a Halifax church choir on an outing to Ilkley Moor near Ilkley, West Yorkshire The song tells of a lover courting the object of his affections, Mary Jane, on Ilkley Moor without a hat (baht 'at). The singer chides the lover for his lack of headwear \u2013 for in the cold winds of Ilkley Moor this will mean his death from exposure. This will in turn result in his burial, the eating of his corpse by worms, the eating of the worms by ducks and finally the eating of the ducks by the singers. In The Yorkshire Dictionary (Arnold Kellett, 2002) it was said the song (i.e., the lyrics) probably originated from the Halifax area, based on the dialect which is not common to all areas of Yorkshire. The title is seen in various transcriptions of the dialect, but is most commonly On Ilkla Mooar [or Moor] baht 'at, i.e. \"On Ilkley Moor without [wearing] the hat\"; idiomatically \"On Ilkley Moor without (i.e. bar) the hat\". Dr Arnold Kellett reports the traditional belief that the song \"came into being as a result of an incident that took place during a ramble and picnic on the moor. It is further generally believed that the ramblers were all on a chapel choir outing, from one of the towns in the industrial West Riding\". The first published version of the words appeared in 1916, when it was described as \"a dialect song which, for at least two generations past, has been sung in all parts of the West Riding of Yorkshire\".  Arnold Kellett calculates that the song \"could well have originated in the early years of the second half of the [19th] century, and not as late as 1877.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1492392","599302","599298","618582","1261190","1252481","601523"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":"99660"}

Kreisler was always very ambivalent about if this was on purpose and refrained from giving credits to Lehrer. However, Kreisler lived in the US at the time Lehrer started to perform the song in 1953 (six years before it was released) and didn't even deny to have been to Lehrer's performances.
