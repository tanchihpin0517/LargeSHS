The text of the Ukrainian folk song \"Oi ne khody, Hrytsiu\" was first published in English translation in London in 1816. A Polish translation first appeared in 1822 in Lviv and a German translation appeared in 1848.

Composed to commemorate the Battle of Cer, in which Serbia defeated Austro-Hungary (1914), the tune, (mis)taken for a partisan song, was also very popular in the post-WW II Yugoslavia and even played at Ivo Andri\u0107's Nobel Prize award cermony (1961). Swedish artist and publisher Felix Stahl subsequently aquired the publishing rights and promoted it leading to recordings by quite some artists. With the eponymous 1963 movie (performed by an orchestra directed by Vasilije Mokranjac, who also composed the rest of the score), it got known outside of Europe, too. From 1992 to 2004, the song even served as Serbia's national anthem.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["616996","615787","619716","616629","618045","616138","620607","616129","618047","616926","615791","615797","620634","615815","616992","616969","620608","616142","1328693","615826","1557630","618042","620626"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"50304","managed_by":null}

Traditional African-American spiritual from the 1800s first published in 1907 as \"Going to Shout All over God's Heav'n\". Verse one has \"robes\", verse two has wings, verse three has \"harps\" and verse four has \"shoes\". Depending on the verse ordering it can be named accordingly. It was first recorded by the Fisk Jubilee Singers in 1909 as \"Shout All over God's Heaven\" (which is also part of the verse one lyrics).  In 1923, Eugene O'Neill wrote a play called \"All God's Chillun Got Wings\" which was inspired by this spiritual. Paul Robeson sang the title song in the 1924 premiere.  Thereafter, the song was typically only known by \"All God's Chillun Got Wings (or Shoes)\".  In 1925, the song was arranged into \"I Got Shoes\", which eventually evolved into a 1962 gospel song by Johnny Cash of the same name.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1052843","615425","615432","1052857","615424","615427","621007","1052853","1071269","1052840","1074400","1536189","1110844","972842"],"submission_ids":["292883","292889","264391","292894","105081"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"6487","managed_by":null}
