While agiographies all agree on attributing the Neapolitan version of the lyrics to Saint Alphonsus Liguori, it is unlikely that he also wrote the simpler, more modern and less elaborate Italian lyrics. Nevertheless (or perhaps for this reason) the Italian version, commonly known as \"Tu scendi dalle stelle\", has become a Christmas standard in Italy, so that Giuseppe Verdi was quoted to say: \"There is no Christmas without Tu scendi dalle stelle\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["619627","619855","619625","619811","1487521","1235711","851008","1015382","885016","999078"],"submission_ids":["110733"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"19","managed_by":null}

He was originally a sailor from Jamaica but Seth Davy became a fixed character on the streets of Liverpool where he entertained people, and especially young children, with his three dancing dolls which he made himself. The famous dancing dolls were attached to the end of a plank which Seth Davy would tap with his hand to make them dance while he crooned his minstrel songs. Seth Davy\u2019s stage was the street outside the Bevington Bush Hotel on the north side of the city of Liverpool. He was known to sing minstrel songs and his most popular one which he was often heard singing was called \u2018Massa is a Stingy Man.\u2019 It is an old minstrel song from across the Atlantic and it contains the lines which would go on to form the later ballad about the street entertainer: \u2018Sing come day go day, god send Sunday, we\u2019ll drink whiskey all the week, and butter milk on Sunday.\u2019 There are two versions of \u2018The Ballad of Old Seth Davy,\u2019 the original one written by Glyn Hughes and an Irish one which replaces some of the Liverpool place names with Dublin ones. When you hear the song performed in Ireland you will notice some of the lyrics are altered such as Bevington Bush which is replaced with the Dublin location of Beggars\u2019 Bush. It is not known who or why the lyrics were altered for Irish ears, but the song has been recorded by many artists over the years including The Ballad of Seth Davy, while in 1968 Danny Doyle\u2019s recording of the song reached the number one spot in the Irish charts and stayed there for ten weeks. \u2018The Ballad of Old Seth Davy\u2019 ends on a rather sad note as we are informed that he died in 1902. His famous dancing dolls were thrown in a \u2018jowler bin\u2019 which is Liverpool slang for a rubbish bin that was a common feature in the alleys at the back of houses in the city, while the plank they danced on was used to patch up someone\u2019s back door.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["622992","723837","1464947","1073054","622991","1464941","1085363","622998","723836","1550035","1023427","991963","1561169"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":["24829","24829"],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":"62883"}
