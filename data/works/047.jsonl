Any old place I hang my hat Seems like home to me. cho: Don't let your deal go down. Don't let your deal go down. Don't let your deal go down, sweet mama Till your last old dollar's gone. When I left my love behind, She's standin' in the door; She throwed her little arms around my neck and said, \"Sweet daddy please don't go!\" Now it's who's gonna shoe your pretty little feet? Who's gonna glove your hand? And who's gonna kiss your ruby lips Honey, who's gonna be your man? She says, \"Papa will shoe my pretty little feet, Mama will glove my hand. You can kiss my rosy lips When you get back again.\" Where did you get them high-heel shoes. And that dress you wear so fine? Got my shoes from a railroad man Dress from a driver in the mine.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["652605","652689","1048041","652991","1048816","653001","652976","652982","977216","939570","871605","1014778","940358","947914","652969","652993","989663","909149","1104557","772829","1075746","1081354","661493","1046081","1330973","1146877","1059056","801522","1414443","940403","1036133","758072","807116","966942","1092289","653363","927565","1312302","1029724","980859","961485","1015116","1246486","1075814","1056107","1091271","1267930","1390896","927859","1564793","975293","966582","1056775","653238","653223","652636","933197","971699","1102063","933198","937848","1094893","652608","929952","1389303","1026575","934039","1094833","964776","1106595","654668","1038873","975142","1052143","1049884","980128"],"submission_ids":["289557"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"6487","managed_by":null}

Earliest known text was published in 1817. Variations were collected in the Southern Appalachians by Cecil Sharp.  The last verse of Kelly Harrell's 1926 recording of \"O! Molly Dear Go Ask Your Mother\" is almost identical to the usual first verse of \"Katie Dear.\" The melody of Harrell's song is closely related (if not identical) to that of \" Wayfaring Stranger \". Synopsis - A young man has slept over at his lover's house and it's morning time and he's being warned to rise and go as he will wake her father or mother (who may have a silver dagger by her side) The \"Katie Dear\" versions will usually open \"Oh Katie (or Molly or Peggy) dear go ask your mother if you can be a bride of mine, if she says yes come back and tell me, If she says no we\u2019ll run away...\" The Carter Family recorded a version in 1938 that added the opening of \"Who's That Knockin' at My Window\" but after that it involves the same theme of all the other variants.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["923082","1063015","1067104","192778","1063048","1047202","1063016","1063099","255638","1338390","1063011","700486","961504","192777","1072244","1021338","1216995","925490","1021335","1067126","1021348","1288707","401141","401146","1021360","1021343","1054986","588608","1067112","488558","470076","369854","1063058","1058069","1063029","1063014","461214","1478275","1063046","1212672","1572170","1555071","1050353","1572044"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"6487","managed_by":null}

Synopsis - \"The singer meets (Dermot) and expresses surprise at how healthy and prosperous he looks. Dermot explains that he had had a dream which showed him the consequences of his actions. Awakening in relief, Dermot has reformed his ways.\"  The earliest recording appears to be Riley Puckett's June 15, 1925 performance. The original performances started out \"Oh don't you look so much better now, your clothes are neat and clean....\".  The Stanley Brothers' 1962 recording opened \"Oh Edmund you look so pleasant now, your clothes look neat and clean...\" so typically performances now will reference Edmund (or Ed) in the opening line. Note 1 - There is a work on SHS called The Drunkard's Hell that generally begins \"It was on a dark and stormy night...\". It can have performances named \"Drunkard's Dreams\", including a 1928 recording by Posey Rorer and The North Carolina Ramblers, The Drunkard's Dream . Note 2 - There is another similarly themed song first recorded in 1928 by Ted Chesnut called The Drunkard's Doom that is typically known as I Saw a Man at the Close of Day after Grayson & Whitter's 1929 recording.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["653593","653534","1078727","1078740","653602","1041636","923040","1078941","1104029","1040925","1496162","925116","1078902","870969"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"6487","managed_by":null}
