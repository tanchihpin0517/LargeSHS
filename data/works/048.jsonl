Possibly an Underground Railroad song. It was adapted and widely performed during the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s.  Boll Weavil Jackson's 1926 recording of \"I'm on My Way to Kingdom Land\" seems to have been the basis for the subsequent Canaan Land adaptations. 1929 lyrics of \"I'm on My Way to Caneyan Land\" from song in a play by E.C.L. Adams: If you don't go, don't hinder me (3x) I'm on my way, great God, I'm on my way I'm on my way to Canaan land (3x) I'm on my, great God, I'm on my way One of the earliest recorded versions by Blind Nesbit in 1930 used these lyrics - CHORUS: I am on my way, to the Canaan land (3x) I'm on my way, praise God, I'm on my way. VERSE 1: Oh Joseph was a religious man, He had trouble at home and all over the land. Joseph was afflicted from his head to his feet, His wife came in, said, \"How do you feel?\" Then Joseph began to shout, CHORUS: I am on my way, to the Canaan land I'm on my way, to the Canaan land. If Jesus will, might come to be I'm on my way, praise God, I'm on my way.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1032759","962837","962260","962238","661963","802089","1032756","962596","945107","978383","1071567","962540","1102858","962546","962781","1066979","840512","661964","1070810","1354501","1229989","1211481","1180288","970425","1020787","1029086"],"submission_ids":["155405","233899"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}
