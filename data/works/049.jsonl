Like many folk songs, it is known by a variety of titles such as \"Rambler, Gambler\", \"I'm a Rambler, I'm a Gambler\", and \"Rose of Aberdeen\". The song begins with the lines: \"I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler, I'm a long way from home And the people who don't like me, they can leave me alone\" The lyrics mention two towns in Texas, Belton and Saline as well as the state of Wyoming.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["950418","950415","950414","1032153","1049163","1058199","950421","1032154","1055053","678754","1602407","1602408","950405"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":["9566","9566"],"type":"Song","added_by":"52961","managed_by":null}
