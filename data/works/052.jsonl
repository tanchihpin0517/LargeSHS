Its origins and authorship are currently in question. It is suspected of originally being a solo instrumental guitar work, from the 19th century. It has variously been attributed to Antonio Rubira, David del Castillo, Francisco T\u00e1rrega , Fernando Sor , Daniel Fortea, Miguel Llobet, Antonio Cano, Vicente G\u00f3mez and Narciso Yepes . On the earliest recording of \"Romance\" on a cylinder, featuring guitarist Sim\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez made in Madrid sometime between 1897 and 1901, the work in question is titled \"Sort-Estudio para Guitarra por S. Ramirez\". It is highly likely that the name \"Sort\" \u2014 as it occurs on the cylinder's title \u2014 refers to Fernando Sor , as Sor's surname is sometimes also spelled \"Sort\" or \"Sorts\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1468592","1467403","909772","1407963","1278126","1058702","1289081","1588889","707231","1564450","821343","1566325","256014","1338187","1314780","1269417","1557161","1079389","924097","257346","152235","1528852","1557010","1040035","592642","1194266","1218538","1328682","595481","1178981","313052","120849","1130380","1556045","592685","121059","1607129","420690","118190","592688","805568","699589","965489","1322230"],"submission_ids":["222201","222381","223102","222258","230586","267796","228977","229027","222421","226316","268476","226590","227896","224320","226315","229055","222181","224612","229109","229276","230648","226906","230593","222822","222804","223604","229344","223218","230600","222735","226253","227771","226805","227648","140881","106491","222423","222250","227765","222321","229402","227549","222169","222739","224452","222734","228791","229497","222386","222387","228857","229504","223438","226238","222945","228916","224608","223150","222506","222942","223437","224453","229540","222943","227547","229508","222323","222815","226314","226908","229577","230636","222383","222486","226358","227347","224456","228145","223103","224605","226979","222495","223613","222202","227228","222413","229578","229502","224437","226659","230651","224611","229615","227313","229630","227551","224383","224565","222419","223093","227034","227852","227233","227891","229659","223511","227849","226828","227764","223639","226903","226976","226907","226657","226831","231109","226347","227126","227763","230807","226662","228051","226830","226829","227021","227324","222174","224450","228062","224451","228792","227032","227659","226905","226592","223101","222322","223104","229483","222265","227851","229665","226969","227550","229056","222317","222175","226966","223436","222564","226352","227893","228903","222750","222813","222946","226239","228973","227027","31230"],"web_cover_ids":["22396","22396","22605","22605","22457","22457","22460","22460","22458","22458","22466","22466","22552","22552","22499","22499","22494","22494","22482","22482","22459","22459"],"type":"Song","added_by":"52961","managed_by":"2"}
