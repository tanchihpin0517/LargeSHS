In the years since it was written, Schwartz described the lyric as 'too sentimental'. In the early 1990s, when planning for a Los Angeles production of Godspell, Schwartz changed the lyrics influenced by the aftermath of the riots in Los Angeles. Though the Los Angeles production never came into being, the newer version is the one predominantly used in Godspell productions since then. Original first verse: Come sing me sweet rejoicing \/ Come sing me love \/ We're not afraid of voicing \/ All the things \/ We're dreaming of \/ Oh, high and low \/ And everywhere we go 1990s first verse: Out of the ruins and rubble \/ Out of the smoke \/ Out of our night of struggle \/ Can we see a ray of hope \/ One pale thin ray reaching for the day?","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["750305","784942"],"submission_ids":["311018"],"web_cover_ids":["14013","14013","14012","14012"],"type":"Song","added_by":"51650","managed_by":null}

Interstingly, he measured the metre to fit to \"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\", which is the basis for both Austria's and entire Germany's anthems. Becher asked the composers Ottmar Gerster and Hanns Eisler to set music to his lyrics. After two presentations, the Politburo decided in favor of Eisler's compostition.
