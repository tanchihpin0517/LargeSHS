Haka are performed to welcome distinguished guests, or to acknowledge great achievements, occasions or funerals. New Zealand sports teams' practice of performing a haka before their international matches has made the haka more widely known around the world.

Nearly succeeding, he saved all passengers and, being the only one killed, became a legend. T.
