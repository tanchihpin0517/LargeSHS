Don Backy, a member of the Clan Celentano , wrote the song and planned to sing it at the Sanremo Festival. Backy left the clan following a spat with Celentano, who in turn forced Backy to give up his place at Sanremo in favor of himself. Moreover, it is said that Celentano's arrangement and performance were purposely half-hearted, to undermine the commercial success of the song.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["831455","1025243","831456","1024904","1023753","831457","1025252","1024719","1024887","1024687"],"submission_ids":["137575"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"19","managed_by":"52961"}
