Both lyrics and music were written in 1943 by Stanis\u0142aw Magierski (nom de guerre \"Jacek II\"), a pharmacist from Lublin and a member of the Resistance. The most widely known version of the song, however, differs significantly from Magierski's original version, as the song was passed around through word of mouth. The lyrics describe the longing of a partisan, who is unable to come and see his beloved, because he has to hide out in the forest.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1345118"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"52961","managed_by":"680"}
