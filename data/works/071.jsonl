There is some speculation that Metz heard the tune earlier, sung by an entertainer called \u201cMama Lou\u201d in Babe Connor's well-known brothel in St. Louis, Missouri and appropriated it with changed lyrics. The song is a standard, sometimes referred to as \u201cAmerica\u2019s national ballad\u201d (although it is not, properly, a ballad). It was adopted as a marching song by Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Rough Riders during the Battle of San Juan Hill. The University of Wisconsin has used it as a theme since the 1890s. Several other American university marching bands include it in their recurring repertoires. It has also been used regularly at political rallies in the US.
