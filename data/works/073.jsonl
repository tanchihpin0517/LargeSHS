Sadie Vimmerstedt, who lived in Youngstown, Ohio, was a big fan of Johnny Mercer\u2019s music. She wrote the opening line \u2018I want to be around to pick up the pieces, when somebody breaks yours heart\u2019 and felt it sounded like a Johnny Mercer song. She mailed a letter to \u2018Johnny Mercer, Songwriter, New York.\u2019 The post office forwarded the letter to ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers), who got the letter to Mercer. Mercer wrote the melody himself and completed the lyrics for \u201cI Wanna Be Around\u201d in 1959 and asked Tony Bennett to record it, which he did in 1962. Mercer gave 50% of the profits to Ms. Vimmerstedt, which made her a wealthy woman and enabled her to retire and travel the world. It is one of the great songs in the American Songbook.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["687713","21829","428001","104316","82889","184669","439177","47944","41852","1591567","550899","292976","535495","388138","21830","454422","154023","191629","450559","659158","377874","84736","363414","176627","608074","395608","71127","332004","162258","449062","648505","1237630","197276","862200","1149698","420656","508787","231848","558995","687761","154068","675379","813352","481311","1246850","112591","326957","436916","858222","48262","704511","733144","427665","497120","45083","352977","1478024","547138","170926","603124","645270","945935","994727","436221","177031","835375","759041","645053","190655","252962","274755","1157206","360924","1491566","945701","539645","651118","376911","674286","785862","623902","490055","1583378","608086","814152","709670","659153","880029","877968","1053696","978890","948606","1455246","159505","165884","199732","81690","1517302","748899","935646","418320","647868","589046"],"submission_ids":["284522","237295","226762","271323","279013","272268"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"2","managed_by":null}

Edens had independently arranged to meet with a young Donovan to record some demos to pitch to the major labels. He presented the song to Donovan, he liked it and recorded a demo of it in Summer 1964 (but it never went any farther than a demo).  Taylor's version was completed and finally released in June 1965 to little acclaim (no videos exist or much of anything on Taylor - and you can't search for him as it only calls up the Rolling Stones guitarist, Mick Taylor ).  A friend of the producer's managed The Pretty Things and he heard the song and got them to release it on their Get the Picture? album.  In the book,  \"The Autobiography of Donovan: The Hurdy Gurdy Man\", pages 64-65, Donovan discusses the list of songs he was given to record and one was \"London Town - written by Mick Taylor (after the Tim Hardin style)\".  I also saw discussion from Edens that this song uses some lyrics from a folk song called \" Green Rocky Road \" that Hardin had recorded and when Donovan's recording finally was released decades later it credited Hardin, not Taylor.  I couldn't locate Hardin as an author of \"London Town\" in the PROs so it clearly must have been for his involvement with the \"Green Rocky Road\" song.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["904784","904776","904792","1364820"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}
