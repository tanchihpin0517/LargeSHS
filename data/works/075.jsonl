Though it was not particularly popular among British miners, it took firm hold in mining communities of the U. S. The text was published in the United Mine Workers Journal (February 9, 1911), the entire piece was copyrighted by Blind Andy Jenkins, the singing newspaper vendor from Atlanta, Georgia, in 1926.  The song is about a child imploring his\/her father not to go to the mines today because the child dreamt there would be a fire down in the mines and they would all die. There's a very similar song called Prayer of a Miner's Child that is about a child praying that his\/her coal miner father be safe in the mines and steadily employed.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["926012","926027","1047966","926025","926018","926017","926020","1039230","937398","926019","926028","958876","926033","926022","926026","1097699","1425693","1056948","1002972","926093","1042914","1572528","1099249","1067273","1056951"],"submission_ids":["279789"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

However, Duffey and Roberts now do have a joint registry for their song. Mac Wiseman recorded it in 1966 and he also has a registry for his performance. Wiseman also recorded it as a duet with Lester Flatt in 1971 and there is a registry only in Lester Flatt's name.

It deals with the depredations of London Bridge and attempts, realistic or fanciful, to repair it. It may date back to bridge rhymes and games of the Late Middle Ages, but the earliest records of the rhyme in English are from the seventeenth century. The lyrics were first printed in close to their modern form in the mid-eighteenth century and became popular, particularly in Britain and the US during the 19th century. The most frequently used first verse is: London Bridge is falling down, Falling down, falling down.

The verses often have floating lyrics, though most of the bluegrass versions do tend to mirror The Country Gentlemen and Stanley Brothers recordings. NOTE: There were two recordings of  \"Paul and Silas in Jail\" by Rev. J.M. Gates in  November 1926 and by Washington Phillips in December 1927, but neither of those two belong to this traditional song.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1033425","1033423","1033420","1052934","936707","932892","930834","930082","1010173","932881","1233110","1469404","930831","1051318","941608","1075315","1106811","962118","1028750","1001463","1524141","957213","1087527","1001678","950221","1572563","1483434"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

The setting for this one was Newry, in the North of Ireland. The song concludes with the lines \"And when I'm gone, they will tell the truth, Here lays a wild and wicked youth.\u201d The song was Americanized into the \"Rude and Rambling Man\" or \"The Rambling Boy\" or \"The Rake and Rambling Man (or Boy)\".  The first US version was arranged (or arguably adapted) by Clarence Ashley of The Carolina Tar Heels as \"Rude and Rambling Man\". In 1941, The Carter Family recorded their more famous version called \"The Rambling Boy\".  A.P. Carter registered their version so it is now incorrectly thought of as a Carter Family original, but A.P. just arranged the lyrics.  The Carter Family's version starts off \"I was rich but a rambling boy,  Through many cities I did enjoy...\".  \"The \"Rake and Rambling Boy\" versions just modified the opening line to - \"I'm a rake and a ramblin' Boy, Well I'm a rake and ramblin' boy.  There's many a city I did enjoy...\". NOTE: Not to be confused with the folk song Ramblin' Boy written by Tom Paxton.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1032679","1032692","936369","1044432","1054283","1056026","982424","1032717","930940","1032768","1048286","1052943","959783","1273393","1032767","1032686","1045236","1032766","1100978","930941","1057784","1049577","1084354","1074146","937415","930951","1070379","1037372","1074292","936543","1060339","930944","1057922","1097677","1056233","1032782","1110329","1546436","1032785","930950","1090872","989687","1076782","1032700","1091229"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

Sometimes the beans would be pieced with a needle and thread and strung together, then hung to dry where they would last the winter (but would need to be soaked to re-hydrate them prior to cooking). Alternatively, the title may refer to actual garments made of leather, and it has been pointed out the the playing of the tune on the fiddle involves bowing in a motion that has been likened to the movements in sewing with a needle and thread.
