The girl tells of their departed father and mother, and that the angels took their mother away, but mother said she would come for them some day and that day had come.

Lyrics collected were: I went to see my Hanner turn tricks in the manner T'aint nobodys business but my own Don't care if I don't make a dollar Je'so I wear my shirt and collar T'aint nobodys business but my own It is suggested that the versions recorded by Frank Stokes with Dan Sane at the end of August 1928 and the version Nobody's Dirty Business recorded by Mississippi John Hurt in February 1928 derives from this 'tradition'. The versions recorded by Sara Martin and Anna Meyers in 1922 and by Bessie Smith, Lena Wilson and Alberta Hunter in 1923 were versions of the song published by Porter Grainger, though this published version, it is suggested, derives originally from the 'traditional' material that was being performed in the first decade of the 1900's.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["863867","1321243","476260","940211","364264","428583","1255669","1103642","249790","453280","248966","1015505","700685","1153587","156362","214369","1226131","1089776","1407606","991606","1153971","1287460","1253118","1159704","1176000","1015507","1156451","830487","1526631","379438","412361","1230418","1110288","937352","937366","344440","1030014","937348","937185","1365962","936725","940299","936724","1290158","570184","1214829","947912","929637","412133","936730","1213019","936726","975661","946810","1529726","1030753","1037803","1223549","526830","1056732","1239564","1181259","1578616"],"submission_ids":["259918"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":"62883"}

Ducks in the millpond, Geese in the ocean; Hug them pretty girls, If I take a notion. Cho: Lord, Lord, gonna get on a rinktum, Lord, Lord, gonna get on a rinktum. Ducks in the millpond, Geese in the clover, Jumped in the bed, And the bed turned over. Ducks in the millpond, Geese in the clover, Fell in the millpond, Wet all over.

Flatt & Scruggs released this song in 1959 as \"Cabin in the Hills\" and credited themselves on the release, but it had been written years earlier by B. L. Shook.  The lyrics actually only say \"Cabin on the Hill\" and most of their subsequent releases have it titled \"Cabin on the Hill\".  To add further confusion, Flatt co-wrote a song in 1947 called Little Cabin Home on the Hill with Bill Monroe while he was part of the Blue Grass Boys that sometimes is just called \"Little Cabin on the Hill\" or just \"Cabin on the Hill\".

Gospel hymn popular in the old-time and bluegrass genres written by Elisha Hoffman. It was first recorded by Da Costa Woltz\u2018s Southern Broadcasters on May 5, 1927.  Ernest Stoneman then recorded a version at the famed Bristol, Tennessess sessions two months later. The Carolina Tar Heels recorded a more comedic response song to this called \"I'll Be Washed\" on October 14, 1928, that even refers to the original songwriter Elisha (Hoffman) in the song (saying he was translating the word of God in his song). It is only loosely based on the original and arguably not an adaptation.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1021789","941455","1043339","1101065","1144784","941457","959452","942794","942522","942523","1003769","952035","941510","1495515","946042","1009036","1110303","1093070","945751","957888","1092319","941456","945274","1001497","976798","999448","1014938","956969","1107660","1532253","965993","1031061","1048467","944878","1264522"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

Traditional song from the British Isles usually involving a young lady out in her father's garden who meets a young man (who can be known as John Riley) who asks her to marry and she responds that she's betrothed to a sailor who's been out on the sea for seven years. It turns out the young man is that sailor who has returned home and was testing her fealty.  The song became very popular in Appalachian America and is typically known in the US as \"Pretty Little Miss (or Fair Young Maid) out in the Garden.  The original British Isles versions are typically known by different names.  Cousin Emmy and her husband copyrighted her US variant in 1947, but her lyrics are just an arrangement of the traditional song.
