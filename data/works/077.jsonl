Bishop did publish a sheet music version of the song in 1869.  Other sources have credited Billy Reeves (lyrics) and Frank Campbell, or Rollin Howard, with the song. The first group to popularize the song was Bryant's Minstrels in 1869-70. The original lyrics are now considered offensive and only the chorus is typically sung now: Shoo, fly, don't bother me, Shoo, fly, don't bother me, Shoo, fly, don't bother me, For I belong to somebody.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["815642","1046928","948032","1084584","973521","1053393","1081919","1093332","1087685"],"submission_ids":["313842"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

Lyrics can very but often start out either - \"Fly in the buttermilk, Shoo fly shoo, Skip to my lou, my darling!...\" or can start out \"Skip, skip, skip to my lou....\" \"Skip to My (The) Lou\" is a popular American partner-stealing square dance from the 1840s. It begins with any number of couples skipping hand in hand around in a ring. A lone boy in the center of the moving circle of couples sings, \"Lost my partner, what'll I do?\" as the girls whirl past him. The young man in the center hesitates while he decides which girl to choose, singing, \u201cI'll get another one just like you.\u201d When he grasps the hand of his chosen one, the latter's partner moves to the center of the ring the game. The \"lou\" in the title comes from the word \"loo\", a Scottish word for \"love\". It is known today for being sung by Judy Garland in the 1944 film Meet Me in St. Louis .

The earliest release found to date is by The Chuck Wagon Gang in 1940.  Bill Monroe popularized the song in 1958 and on his original release a \"Kenneth Tuttle\" was credited, and Tuttle had the work registered in his name - which has led to most attributing Easterling's song to Tuttle. Monroe's biography ,\"The Music of BIll Monroe\" (p. 118-119) by Rosenberg\/Wolfe, discusses this and properly attributes the song to Easterling (see attachments). There is another song called \"I Know My Lord's Gonna Lead Me Out\" credited to Albert E. Brumley that has different lyrics, but the same general theme and virtually the same tune.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["952195","952194","1048507","1078626","1034212","973491","1531641","1113960"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

However, Ron Pen, author of \"I Wonder as I Wander: The Life of John Jacob Niles\" suggests that Niles may have actually written it. In October 1929 Niles performed it at a major chamber music festival held at the Library of  Congress in Washington, D.C. attended by high profile guests including the British ambassador and the wife of the President of the U.S. In 1940 songwriter Lou Singer described it as a folk song which he arranged for singer, Maxine Sullivan. He and Maxine Sullivan had previous success with other folk songs including \"Barbara Allen.\" Singer and his song writing partner, Hughie Prince, copyrighted the song. Consequently, many subsequent recordings of \"If I Had a Ribbon Bow\" credit them as the writers. Susan Reed, who recorded this song later in the 1940s, described it as an early American folk song found generally throughout the deep South.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["953842","1556550","953825","953897","1397898","953830","953894","953827","953844","953868","954238","953887","1095981","953823","1525690","1179650","1200790","953881","953846","1160903","1432980"],"submission_ids":["259040"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"6487","managed_by":"99660"}

Several of the subsequent cover performances have been registered in the respective singer's names (including Hank Thompson and Dolly Parton) since this was a public domain song, but their versions have the identical lyrics.

Toward the latter end of the song the musician (or some other person) will ask \"What on earth do you want son\" and the instrument will say back \"I want my mama\", then they will continue a related dialog back and forth about calling your mama. William McCoy first recorded this on December 6, 1927, using a mouth harp harmonica.  Presumably McCoy also wrote this but his release didn't indicate authorship. Salty Holmes recorded a harmonica version on December 12, 1947, with the standard dialog between the musician and the instrument that also had no songwriting credits.  In 1950, Holmes released an \"answer song\" called \"I Found My Mama\". In 1947, Alvino Rey released a jazz version that was credited to \"Salty Holmes\". Flatt & Scruggs recorded the most well-known version at their 1963 Carnegie Hall concert and their version ad-libbed more on the dialog and was obiously a banjo version.

Old-time fiddle tune written and first recorded by Clayton McMichen in 1937.  The brief lyrics are - Dreamy Georgiana moon, No one was there but you. When I looked in your eyes, With a sigh whispered I would be true. Each night brings sorrow to my heart, Tell her that I'll be returning soon, My love's still true, though were many miles apart, Tell her dreamy Georgiana moon.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["954714","1349161","1229208","1034110","1051376","1352163","1414773","1389298","954743","954715","954742","1352359","1352364"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

He seems to have put it together from sections of What a Friend We Have in Jesus and the theme you can hear very near the end of Red Onion Drag (composed in 1927 by Louis Dumaine and Eddie Jackson and recorded that year by Louis Dumaine's Jazzola Eight). NOTE: There is a Victorian hymn called The Lily of the Valley [I've Found a Friend in Jesus] with words written by William Fry for the Salvation Army. Ira Sankey set it to the music of the song The Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane, which had been composed by Will Hays. So when jazz bands play Lily of the Valley, the composers are often incorrectly given as Fry, Sankey and Hays.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1279842","1258505","1082549","1280292","1173660","1288645","1223813","1179828","1174041","1241522","1299953","1200112","1123371","1202702","1145692","1114971","1283044","1205278","1010952","1126174","418470","462523","582229","1109567"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}
