Oh we wandered to the hill where the wildflowers grew, He said \"Every flower reminds me of you\". (Chorus: Just you, sweet you) The lilies he said are your love sweet and true, And the dew sprinkled rose is the image of you. The wild morning glory, in branches does tower, Each sings to me of my pale wildwood flower. (Chorus: Pale Wildwood Flower) So he taught me to love him, and promised to stay, But the summer must end, and the rose fade away. He left me one morning, and he never knew, His pale wildwood flower was withering, too. (Chorus: Poor Wildwood Flower) Now I'm sinking so low, when the light is growing dim, In my hands placed a lily, in memory of him. Tell him I forgive him, though I regret the hour, He walked off and left me, his pale wildwood flower.

Other versions of the song have evolved, including \"The Pale Amaranthus\" (collected in Kentucky and North Carolina, reported in 1911), \"Raven Black Hair\" and \"The Pale Wildwood Flower\" (collected 1915\u20131919), and \"The Frail Wildwood Flower\". Original lyrics - I'll twine 'mid the ringlets of my raven black hair The lilies so pale and the roses so fair The myrtle so bright with an emeral hue And the pale aronatus with eyes of bright blue. I'll sing and I'll dance, my laugh shall be gay I'll cease this wild weeping, drive sorrow away.

In an early version, dating from the 1820s, a Cockney costermonger vowed to be true to his fianc\u00e9e, who had been sentenced to seven years' transportation to Australia for theft and to mourn his loss of her by wearing green willow sprigs in his hatband for \"a twelve-month and a day,\" the willow being a traditional symbol of mourning. In 1975, the English band Steeleye Span had their highest charting hit with All Around My Hat .  The band registered the song as their own but the lyrics came verbatim from two traditional songs.  The chorus came from All Around My Hat and the remaining lyrics were from Fare Thee Well, Cold Winter \/ Farewell He . My love she was fair and my love she was kind too And many were the happy hours, between my love and me I never could refuse her, whatever she'd a mind to And now she's far away, far o'er the stormy sea. All 'round my hat I will wear the green willow All 'round my hat for a twelve month and a day If anybody asks me the reason why I wear it It's all because my true love is far, far away. Will my love be true and will my love be faithful? Or will she find another swain to court her where she's gone? The men will all run after her, so pretty and so graceful And leave me here lamenting, lamenting all alone.

The text of the song relates to the Irish practice of gathering seaweed, which has been done for various purposes, including as fertilizer, bathing, and food. The song is about the mother telling the daughter that the men are coming and the girl wanting to look like she\u2019s good housewife material, i.e., showing them she can spin.  In the second verse, the mother and daughter are talking about how unattractive the fellow is (the dulaman gaelach); however, in the third and fourth verse they\u2019ve decided that he looks like he could afford to spend some money on them, as he can dress himself fairly well. In the fifth verse, the fellow promises the girl a present as an enticement to marriage. However, in the sixth verse the girl\u2019s daddy (who is also a \u2018dulaman gaelach\u2019 \u2013 the names change in this verse) demands to know the fellow\u2019s (the \u2018dulaman maorach\u2019 now) intentions; and, the daddy declares in the last verse that he\u2019ll not let the fellow take his daughter away. However, the upstart says that he\u2019ll just kidnap her! There are many traditional and contemporary versions of the song's melody. Among the best known settings (derived from the Scottish strathspey \"Cutting Ferns\") is that of Clannad, who recorded it for their 1976 album D\u00falam\u00e1n. A slower melody was recorded by Altan on their 1993 album Island Angel.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["963178","963177"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

It bemoans the plight of the Irish emigrants who so longed for home from their new lives in America. This song is sung by a man who longs for his home in Spancill Hill, County Clare, his friends and the love he left there. All the characters and places in this song are real. He wrote the ballad just before his death and passed it along to his family members.  As is the case with many folk ballads, it\u2019s real lyrics have been altered over the years. In the 1940s while renowned folk singer Robbie McMahon was at a music session in Spancil Hill, he was approached by a woman who identified herself as a relative of Michael Considine and handed McMahon the original lyrics of the ballad. The name of Spancil Hill comes from the ancient horse fair that takes place there every June. Spancilling was an old and rather cruel practice in which a rope was used to tie a horse\u2019s left foreleg to its right hind leg in order to stop it from wandering off. First two verses of lyrics - Last night as I lay dreaming, of the pleasant days gone by, My mind being bent on rambling and to Erin's Isle I did fly. I stepped on board a vision and sailed out with a will, Till I gladly came to anchor at the Cross of Spancilhill. Enchanted by the novelty, delighted with the scenes, Where in my early childhood, I often times have been. I thought I heard a murmur, I think I hear it still, 'Tis that little stream of water at the Cross of Spancilhill.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1005112","963546","1011393","1049295","963567","1007477","1099156","1028111","1096039","1049296","963506","1064800","963436","963435"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

There has been some dispute concerning the location but clearly the Lagan river runs South of Belfast and one of the original verses mentions Lambeg near Belfast. Lagan or Laggan is from the Gaelic for a low place by a river and similar place names can be found in Ireland and Scotland. The melody is based on a traditional air from Galway. Other songs based on the same tune include \"She Moved Thro' the Fair, \"The Quiet Joys of Brotherhood,\" \"White Summer,\" and \"Belfast Child.\" First two verses - Where Lagan stream sings lullaby There blows a lily fair The twilight gleam is in her eye The night is on her hair And like a love-sick leannan-sidhe She has my heart in thrall Nor life I owe nor liberty For love is lord of all. Her father sails a running-barge 'Twixt Leamh-beag and The Druim; And on the lonely river-marge She clears his hearth for him. When she was only fairy-high Her gentle mother died; But dew-Love keeps her memory Green on the Lagan side.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1007584","1009719","1049315","1011293","1582127","1044845","1073044","1042350","1287900","963614","963612","1150686","1113579","1013282","1510106","1030227","1289173","1007585","1007586","1515733","1074182"],"submission_ids":["286557","294652"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":"2"}

English: \"The Hope\") is a 19th century Jewish poem and the national anthem of Israel. Its lyrics are adapted from a poem by Naftali Herz Imber. The melody for \"Hatikvah\" derives from \"La Mantovana\", a 16th-century Italian song, composed by Giuseppe Cenci (Giuseppino del Biado) ca. 1600 with the text \"Fuggi, fuggi, fuggi da questo cielo\". Its earliest known appearance in print was in the del Biado's collection of madrigals. It was later known in early 17th-century Italy as Ballo di Mantova. This melody gained wide currency in Renaissance Europe, under various titles, such as the Pod Krakowem (in Polish), Cucuruz cu frunza-n sus [Maize with up-standing leaves] (in Romanian) and the Kateryna Kucheryava (in Ukrainian). It also served as a basis for a number of folk songs throughout Central Europe, for example the popular Slovenian children song \u010cuk se je o\u017eenil [The little owl got married] (in Slovenian). The melody was used by the Czech composer Bed\u0159ich Smetana in his set of six symphonic poems celebrating Bohemia, \"M\u00e1 vlast\" (\"My homeland\"), namely in the second poem named after the river which flows through Prague, Vltava; the piece is also known under its German title as Die Moldau (The Moldau). The adaptation of the music for \"Hatikvah\" was set by Samuel Cohen in 1888. Cohen himself recalled many years later that he had hummed Hatikvah based on the melody from the song he had heard in Romania, Carul cu boi.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Hatikvah written by Naftali Herz Imber","adapted_from_id":"250821","performance_ids":["1223765","964556","1223763","964335","964367","1344693","1168418","964563","1157918","1344691","1168425","1168408"],"submission_ids":["151749"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"53130","managed_by":null}

Pete Seeger recorded his version in 1948 and in his introduction he said that a local from Winnsboro, South Carolina had added some verses to the traditional blues song \"Alcoholic Blues\". Theme is about \"Old Man Sargent, sitting at the desk, The damned old fool won't give us no rest. He'd take the nickels off a dead man's eyes....\". The singer describes the bad conditions in the mills, and instructs listeners not to bury his body when he dies. Lyrics: Old man Sargent sitting at the desk, The damned old fool won't give us no rest. He'd take the nickels off a dead man's eyes, To buy a Coca-cola and a Pomo Pie. I've got the blues, I've got the blues, I've got the Winnsboro Cotton Mill blues, Lordy, lordy, spoolin's hard, You know and I know, I don't have to tell: Work for Tom Watson, got to work like hell. I've got the blues, I've got the blues, I've got the Winnsboro Cotton Mill blues. (Repeat after each verse) When I die, don't bury me at all, Just hang me up on the spoolroom wall. Place a knotter in my hand, So I can spool in the Promised Land. When I die, don't bury me deep, Bury me down on 600 Street, Place a bobbin in each hand, So I can dolph in the Promised Land.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"The Alcoholic Blues written by Albert Von Tilzer , Edward Laska","adapted_from_id":"222787","performance_ids":["965297","965298","973063","1092225","1041973","980825"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}
