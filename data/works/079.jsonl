Additional verses are sung by omitting the first letter sung in the previous verse and clapping instead of actually saying the word.  The earliest reference to any form of the song is from the title of a piece of sheet music published in 1780, which attributed the song to William Swords, an actor at the Haymarket Theatre of London.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["972499","972477","1067211","972474","972468"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

Song dates back to at least 1866 when sheet music titled \"Death of Little Joe\" was published.  The sheet music credited V.E. Marsten as composer with no mention of the lyricist.  In 1876 another set of sheet music was published crediting Charles E. Addison.  The Carter Family recorded it on May 8, 1934 as \"Darling Little Joe\" (and again on June 8, 1938, as \"Little Joe\").  Their 1934 recording wasn't issued until 1965, while their 1938 recording was released in 1939.  A.P. Carter registered the work so it is often incorrectly assumed to be their original.

This true incident involved the C & O's Fast Flying Virginian (FFV) train near Hinton, West Virginia on October, 23, 1890.  The train was on its way to Clifton Forge, Virginia, when it hit a rock slide. Early accounts record that the engineer, George Alley, remained on the train to try to slow it and save the lives of its passengers. Alley died at the scene. The song was first recorded in September 1924 by George Reneau as \"The C & O Wreck\". The actual author of the song is unknown, but likely authored by one of the train engineers at the scene and first published in a 1913 railroad magazine.  The tune appears to be the same as the one for The Wreck of the Old 97 , which was in turn borrowed from Henry Clay Work's 1865 song The Ship That Never Returned . Along came the F.F.V. The swiftest on the line She was runnin' down the C&O road Just twenty-five minutes behind There are two other different train wreck songs on SHS involving the C & O Railway with very similar names, The Wreck of the C & O No. 5 and The Wreck of the C & O Sportsman .  Additinoally, Carson Robison wrote two very similar themed train songs called The Wreck of the Number Nine and The Wreck of the 1256 .","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1015138","1043678","1015317","1015135","1043676","1063306","1057316","1010598","1020048","1015131","1104919","1015134","1055991","1097422","1010660","1015133","1066363","1015132","1043828","1010662","1077208","975182","1088529","1031190","1031293","1099453","1286335"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

His release just said he arranged the traditional song. Synopsis - The singer sees a man at a \"grog shop door\" (i.e. a disreputable bar).
