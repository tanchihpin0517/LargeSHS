From there the lyrics can often be floating. Kum ba ya (or yah) or Come by Here is an African American spiritual of disputed origin, but known to be sung in the Gullah culture of the islands off South Carolina and Georgia, with ties to enslaved West Africans. The song is thought to have spread from the islands to other Southern states and the North, as well as other places in the world. The first known recording was in 1926 as \"Come by Here\" by someone known only as H. Wylie, who sang in the Gullah dialect. It later became a standard campfire song in scouting and summer camps and enjoyed broader popularity during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1033207","1033209","1206881","1033220","1067189","978738","1052989","914317","1033233","914320","1300854","916908","1303047","1492015","1288010","1443467","1468588","1033228","1186191","1033225","1547302","1393739","1072558","1399921","1378126"],"submission_ids":["121249","121254","121247","121270","99770","121250","121246","295809","264371","121266","121265"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"62883","managed_by":null}

The fourth line almost always begins \"(I) wouldn't (or, don't) mind dying\". It concludes in various ways in different versions, for example \"If dying was all\", or \"But I gotta go by myself\", or \"Because I'm a child of God\".

In 1837 he published heavily revised versions of the pieces under the new name \"Douze Grandes \u00c9tudes\" (\"Twelve Grand Studies\", S.137) and then revised them again, publishing them in 1852 under the name \"\u00c9tudes d'ex\u00e9cution transcendante\" (\"Transcendental Studies\", S.139). While Liszt did perform individual pieces within the series in public, it is not thought that he performed any of these series in their entirety. Ferruccio Busoni was possibly the first person to do so, in Berlin on 7 February 1903 and again on 15 December 1904. It is not definitively known which variation of the series Busoni performed in 1903 (some researchers suggest the 1837 variation) but in 1904 it seems likely he performed the 1852 variation.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["983683","983694"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Classical work","added_by":"21","managed_by":null}
