When PorSuiGieco was published in 1976, the last Argentine military dictatorship was already underway. It was inconceivable that a song like \"El fantasma de Canterville\", which contained phrases like \"I was always a fool who believed in legality\" or \"I have died many times riddled in the city\" that stood out notoriously and was sung louder in the Recitals will go unnoticed for military censorship. The group must replace it, in this way Charly writes \"Before tour\", a song that talks about the life of the musicians during the tours.

It is often credited to Irishmen Seamus Kavanagh and Patrick J. Ryan, but the lyrics of their song closely follow those of Mahoney and Wenrich's original.  The song is typically titled \"Moonlight in Mayo\" and has been popularized by many Irish recording artists (and thus often mistakenly presumed to be of Irish origins).  It was first performed at the Majestic Theater in Chicago in 1914 by Wenrich and his singing partner, Dolly Connolly.  The first recordings were made in 1915.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1005905","1005899","1005897","1005922","1005921","1353862","1005909","1005775","1024601","1005910"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

The mourners at his wake become rowdy, and spill whiskey over Finnegan's corpse, causing him to come back to life and join in the celebrations.

Shadduck.  Charlie (Charles) D. Tillman set the text to music and published it as \"The Judgment\" in 1893 (or possibly 1894).  The musical component has a complicated past as it's been subsequently published with authorship claims by many, including L.L. Pickett in 1894, F.L. Eiland in 1898, R.E. Winsett in 1934, Virgil O. Stamps in 1939, and Renus E. Rich in 1957. L.L. Pickett is solely credited on Homer E. Rodeheaver's 1913 original gospel song as well as the 1930 gospel version by the McCravy Brothers. R.E. Winsett is solely credited on Roy Acuff's 1941 recording.  Acuff's was the first country rendition and it became a hit and now most releases credit Winsett.  However, since there isn't a great distinction musically or lyrically between the performances, SHS is crediting the original copyright holder for the musical aspect, Charlie D. Tillman (and not Pickett or Winsett,...), and crediting the lyrics to Bertram H. Shadduck.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"A Dream [Poem] written by Bertram H.
