The tale has been reworked in many forms; it frequently appears attributed as a Mother Goose rhyme.

I subsequently found that Scott's Rag is a different tune. After some more research, I found that in 1963 Maybelle Carter told the New Lost City Ramblers she learned it from a guitar player at an Old Dominion Barn Dance in Richmond, Virginia in the early 1950's. The song was also recorded by Mike Seeger of the New Lost City Ramblers and Sam Mcgee.\"","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1012861","1012862","1012864","1013103","1083551","1093304","1043846","1012863"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}

It describes the efforts of an unfaithful wife to explain away the evidence of her infidelity.  The song appeared in David Herd's 1776 compilation Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs. In it a husband (goodman) comes home to find a strange horse there. When he asks his wife what the horse is doing there she calls him stupid and blind, and says that it is a milk cow her mother sent her. The man retorts that in all his travels he never saw a saddle on a cow.  The song has many lyrical variants and is known by different names including \"Three\/Four\/Five\/Six\/Seven Nights Drunk\", \"Coming Home Late\", and \"Shickered as He Could Be\".  It's also sung in America as \"Cabbage Head\". In the version known as \"Seven Nights Drunk\" (made famous by The Dubliners), each night is a verse, followed by a chorus, in which the narrator comes home in a drunken state to find evidence of another man having been with his wife, which she explains away, not entirely convincingly.  Interestingly, despite the title, on The Dubliners single release they only sing the verses of the first five nights as apparently the label felt the verses of nights six and seven were too lewd to get airplay.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1041212","1031164","1096052","1078756","1013449","1097577","1057855","1047295","1097442","1036451","1046598","1014333","1047312","1013430","1047594","1097386","1013435","1097418","1097372","1041351","1090936","1097578","1089598","937379","1097394","1331418","1091443","1597137","1013429","1014357","1030355","1315714","1097776"],"submission_ids":["230054","158501","67004"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

Gary Davis.  The story goes that Rev. Davis learned this song in his teens but wouldn't play the lyrics as he felt they were too sacreligious (the Candy Man was slang for a drug dealer) but at the turn of the century drugs such as cocaine weren't illegal or yet known to be scourges.  Mississippi John Hurt altered the lyrics and recorded his version in December 1928.  In the early 1960s, many of the folk revivalists spent time with Rev. Davis and he taught them this song and it was popularized by Jack Elliott and Dave Van Ronk.  NOTE: SHS has set up Mississippi John Hurt's rendition as an adaptation but it can be argued that it was just an arrangement.

The music was composed by Chaplin for the 1952 movie Limelight .  Terry is the central female character's name in the movie. Only the music was played in the movie.  It became so popular that Englishmen Geoff Parsons and John Turner quickly added lyrics and the new song was christened \"Eternally\" (and it is now known as the Theme from \"Limelight\" even though it was not actually in the movie). The movie was re-released in US in 1972 as it had been boycotted in America during the initial release because Chaplin was caught up in the McCarthy hearings and Chaplin won the Oscar for \"Best Original Dramatic Score\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1016802","520128","717622","1309422","1014854","1565190","1291543","888300","1578493","1009755","1016512","700338","522378","1359760","929488","1417298","1519006","975046","1086758","802670","1601782","553400","761928","1322302","1566097","1318480","1009770","988544","804096","1077990","1080890","1000201","686542","1325139","1216932","1344083","1581308","1448706","1509006","707355","356980","920351","595469","686558","1361650","1023376","1250191","686548","945993","1444772","1000855","1252861","1204739","162376","756855","1151549","1260090","754219","626512","1314431","1357332","902756","1000202","1162452"],"submission_ids":["304426","195628","234678","232557","212866","306673","247624","261893","296684","125621","97527","297333","176819"],"web_cover_ids":["3014","3014"],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":"78739"}

John Morgan\", and \"Turchin's Got Your Mule\".  This song \"Here's Your Mule\" was written by C.D. Benson and published in 1862.  The song tells one of the traditional stories about soldiers hiding a farmer's mule and yelling \"Mister, here's your mule\" while taking the animal from place to place endlessly. The chorus is: Come on, come on, Come on, old man, And don't be made a fool, By ev'ry one, You meet in camp, With \"Mister, Here's your mule.\" Following John Morgan's 1863 raid, sheet music destined for the Southern market had a chorus pasted in immediately after the final verse: Come on, come on, come on, old man, And don't be made a fool; I'll tell you the truth as best I can: \"John Morgan's got your Mule!\"","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1017707","1035576","1042875","1035574","1035579"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}
