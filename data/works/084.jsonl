More recently, lyrics have been set to this tune and several vocal versions have been released.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1023836","1448253","1078500","1023837","1078366","1184791"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"6487","managed_by":null}

A documentary about the song states that the melody was adapted from a Polish folk song \u201cPytala Sie Pani,\u201d and that fiddler Cotton Collins molded the tune into a Texas fiddle song after hearing it in Bremond, a Texas Polish community. Other sources claim that Collins heard the song while he was serving in the U.S. Army in Germany during WWII. At any rate, in 1946 Collins\u2019 performance of the song with the Lone Star Playboys proved to be a popular number at dances. After one such event at Westphalia Hall, the establishment\u2019s manager, B. J. Lignau, commented to the band that Collins\u2019 \u201cNo Name Waltz\u201d was a crowd pleaser. Because the song had no name, Lignau suggested the title \u201cWestphalia Waltz\u201d in honor of the town.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1026300","1026322","1026315","1026301","1075052","1026422","1102052","1286928","1448351","1078475","1026274","1033838","1026278","1026402","1056374","1029768","1026323","1026400","1095736","1038870","1026275","1095064"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

Old Time, Breakdown and Song. USA, southwestern Va. F Major (Charlie Higgins): G Major (Al Hopkins). Standard tuning (fiddle).

Silly Bill was also a mid-19th century name for a clown, an entertainer who could be found at fairs and in street performances, and who played the stooge for another comic character. Perhaps propelled by the alliteration (\"Silly Billy\") the term became generalized to mean a foolish person. The tune was a Galax, Va., regional favorite, but the song (sung to various airs) enjoyed widespread popularity in the late 19th and early 20th century, and has been collected from Mississippi to Michigan. Old Bill, poor Bill, poor old Silly Bill. He wishes me to marry him, but I hardly think I will. Silliest fellow, fellow I've ever seen; He's neither black or yellow, but he's altogether green.

By the time the song was next recorded in the 1920s it had adapted into these floating verses - \"Let's have a party, let's have a time\/Let's have a party, I've only a dime\"; \"Work on the railroad, sleep on the ground\/Eat soda crackers, ten cents a pound.\" Chorus: \"Roll on the ground, boys, roll on the ground (x2).\"  Typically they will say \"Big Ball(s) in Town (or Brooklyn or Nashville or Memphis or Boston or Cowtown), big ball's in town, big ball's in XXX Town, we'll dance around\". In 1949, Hoyle Nix recorded his version titled \"Big Ball's in Cowtown\" and was the first C&W rendition.  He registered his version as his own original work. In 1966, Bob Wills recorded Nix's rendition and credited Nix on the album.  Wills' song became very popular and has resulted in Nix often being attributed as the author of this song family when he largely just arranged his version (just as many had before and after him). George Strait's rendition with Asleep at the Wheel is the most well known version in the 21st century. The song then evolved into a bluegrass song called \"Big Ball in Boston\" (as well as a version by the Kingston Trio with significantly revised lyrics).","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1029821","1029571","1029578","1030010","1029563","1029547","1029313","185558","1029712","1029822","1063125","185559","1048918","1029685","1029301","388565","336827","576136","1029344","1084078","576133","913444","1029823","185560","1029739","1102175","1102055","1103695","1033270","965735","1025078"],"submission_ids":["168989"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

A beggar comes over the hills one day, and knocks on the door of a local farmer and asks for a roof for the night. Curiously, he will not accept a bed in the barn, but wishes only to sleep by the kitchen fire. Late at night, the farmer's daughter comes down to lock the kitchen door. The beggar and daughter exchange words, and fall in love. They sleep together, and through some unmentioned premise, the daughter accuses the man of being a nobleman come dressed as a beggar to woo her. He convinces her that he is indeed only a beggar, and she kicks him out.

The tune and lyrics are very similar to the 17th century Irish tune \"Si\u00fail A R\u00fan\" on which the song is based. This song, travelling with Irish emigrants, has been heard all over UK, and in North America, where it has been put to its most varied use. There, John and Alan Lomax tell us, \u201cits truly exquisite Irish melody carried it into every quarter of America\u201d, being refashioned by shantymen, lumberjacks, farmworkers, soldiers, Negro children and many other social groups. In the process its Gaelic refrain became splendidly mangled, as with this version found in Missouri by Belden: Shale, shale, shale-a mac-a-me, Shule-a mac-a-rac-stack Sally Bobby cue Shule-a mac-a-rac-stack, Sally Bobby Lee Come bibble un-a-boose, said Lora.

There is a recording where Yupanki himself says: These chords belong to an old traditional song that I found many years ago in the Caribbean area on the border of Venezuela and Colombia. It was sung by a colored woman. I learned it, loved it, and walked the world with it.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1031263","1031598","1031492","1031810","1031829","1031275","1031270","1031269","1031490","1031647","1337468","1605039","1500871","1031576","1041568","1031824","1031586","1031540","1031670","1031572","1031672","1303566","1031815","1031485","1441970","1056525","1031594","1389521","1031812","1031823","1322369"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"53130","managed_by":null}

The performances tend to have this refrain to start the song \"Well it's early in the mornin', the mornin', Well, when I rise...\", but can have floating lyrics from there.  Most will also have the refrain \"It takes rocks and gravel, baby to make a solid road\".  Most every performance has been registered by the respective performer as their own. Alan Lomax collected the song as \"Early in the Mornin'\" in 1947 at the Mississippi State Penitentiary's Parchman Work Camp during one of his Southern sojourns.  It was sung by a group of unnamed black prisoners. Lomax registered the song as his own since it hadn't ever been registered. Instead of creating umpteen adaptations, SHS is treating them all as arrangements. NOTE: There is another song called Rocks and Gravel that is derived from the same traditional African-American work song. It is performed as a blues song with much different pace and very different lyrics. Those versions seem to always start with the refrain \"It takes rocks and gravel, baby to make a solid road\".  It's likely that one of the two \"Rocks and Gravel\" Works was the precursor of the other so they should be formally linked, but not certain which one came first.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1032158","1032155","1032147","1032546","1032145","1032144","1032143","1032146","1032169"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

Howard \"Jack\" Thorp in his 1921 book Songs of the Cowboys.  The black cowboy and fiddler, Jess Morris, said he learned the song from a black cowboy named Charley Willis when he was seven years old in 1885.  Morris said Willis told him he learned it from others during a cattle drive in 1871. NOTE: There is a different cowboy song called I Ride an Old Paint and both Works can have performances titled \"Old Paint\" that will typically be credited as traditional, so without audio of the performance it will be difficult to assign them.  However,  the 1928 Goodbye Old Paint by Harry McClintock has elements of both songs so they may actually have common origins.
