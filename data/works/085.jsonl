Novelty song about the singer liking to eat molasses.  Likely first recorded by Hank Penny on July 4, 1939 and released on a Feb 1940 Vocalion single as \"I Like Molasses\".  Penny's release credited someone named \"Lair\" as songwriter. Roy Acuff sang the exact same song at the Grand Old Opry on December 13, 1941 (but never released his rendition).  Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith recorded and released his version in 1947 as \"Lasses\" and credited himself, but his version had the exact same lyrics.  Penny re-recorded his song in 1951 and this time \"Lair\" isn't credited, there is just an arrangement credit to a \"Ty Tobias\". Smith re-recorded his song as well in 1964 as \"I Like 'Lasses\".  However, only Arthur Smith copyrighted his version and the song is always associated with him, but it seems unlikely that he wrote it given that Penny's first recording predated his by eight years. NOTE: There was another molasses song called \"Molasses, Molasses (It's Icky Sticky Goo)\" that was a hit for Teresa Brewer in 1950 and recorded by a number of other artists that year.  There is another song called \"Black Strap Molasses\" and one called \"Molasses Strap Blues\", but they are all distinctly different.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1034778","1034774","1034795","1034771"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":["10934"],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

The song was penned by the editor of the Southern Literary Messenger, John Reuben Thompson, in 1863. Each stanza mentions a separate campaign, starting with First Battle of Bull Run, the Valley Campaign, the Battle of Drewry's Bluff, the Peninsula Campaign, the Battle of Cedar Mountain, the Second Battle of Bull Run, and the Battle of Fredericksburg.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Jordan Is a Hard Road to Travel written by Dan Emmett","adapted_from_id":"228383","performance_ids":["1035592","1043191","1035589","1049732","1035587","1035590"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

His father was very involved in the anti-slavery movement as well as the Underground Railroad. Work used his music as a way to make statements and sentiments about the war. He wrote abolitionist songs, but also made some comedic music. In 1862, as a response to the draft, Work wrote the song \u201cGrafted into the Army.\u201d During this time, all men were drafted into the army unless they sent a substitute for themselves or could pay a three hundred dollar exemption fee. The song \u201cGrafted into the Army,\u201d is sang from the perspective of a mother who learns that her youngest and only surviving son has been drafted into the army. The word \u201cgrafted\u201d is used by Work to emphasize the idea that money is able to substitute for the wealthy men who could have potentially enlisted.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1069387","1035624","1035625","1035618","1035620","1035622"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

Faber's hymn was later edited by unknown parties to make it more appealing to non-Catholics and an additional refrain was added. James G. Walton added these revisions when he set the text to a tune by Englishman Henri F. Hemy called St. Catherine.  Walton must have registered this arrangement as his creation for many performances today credit Walton.

He said he wanted to marry me, that he was single and who knows what. Later I learned that it was not true, that he was married and had children. Why do they play with one like that? Why is one not from their environment? Do you think you can do everything for your money? Well, no!

It's uncertain who wrote these lyrics as they are hodgepodge from other traditionals.  The first verse is lifted directly from Kelly Harrell's April 1926 \"George Collins\" rendition named Dying Hobo . [Verse One] A way out west on a water tank One cold December day An' in the empty car box A dying hobo laid After the first verse, \"Little Stream of Whiskey\" has no relation to Harrell's \"Dying Hobo\", and has zero relation to the actual \"George Collins\" song. However, Little Stream of Whiskey is often referred to as Dying Hobo (hence the confusion attributing the original to Kelly Harrell). The Burnett and Rutherford tune (which contains most of the verses that Doc Watson and others later sang) is all about the dying hobo and his last words to his \"partner hobo\" about going to the place where he \"will not have to work at all\", and where \"a little stream of whiskey is flowing from the rocks\". Though he leaves word for his \"girl in Danville, not to worry at all\". This song has a few lyrics in common with Jimmie Rodgers' \"Hobo Bill's Last Ride\" (attributed to Waldo O'Neal), but the latter mentions nobody else present at the scene. \"Little Stream\" is also related to the \"Big Rock Candy Mountain\" family of songs, in which the hobo describes his paradise.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1038381","1038385","1038575","1038387","1038389","1038410","1038380"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

This one commemorates the death of a locomotive engineer in the Kanawha Valley of West Virginia. Billy Richardson, an engineer on the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad from 1878 to 1910, was known to run fast and on time. People along the C & O recalled that Richardson would wave and whistle as his train sped by.  The affable engineer developed a habit of leaning far out of the right cab window. Richardson\u2019s usual run was from Hinton to Huntington and back. On December 14, 1910, he was running west toward Huntington. Passing through Scary, near St. Albans, Richardson blew the whistle and stuck his head out the window to look back. The mail crane, a track-side device from which trains snatched mail bags on the fly, struck Billy Richardson in the head. The fireman, Cecil Lively, brought the train into Huntington on time. Richardson died shortly after reaching the hospital there. In 1926, a train engineer with the Norfolk & Western named Cleburne Meeks, who as a boy stood in his backyard every other day to wave at Billy Richardson, wrote the song lyrics to \u2018\u2018Billy Richardson\u2019s Last Ride.\u2019\u2019 He sent them to Carson J. Robison, and Robison composed the tune. Vernon Dalhart immediately recorded it in June 1926 for an astonishing seven different record companies.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1043064","1097428","1043066","1056683","1043069"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

Mainly Norfolk indicates Lonesome Luke's fiddle tune did evolve from the tune of the traditional, while Fresno State indicates the fiddle tune is unrelated. But again, when performed with lyrics they always are from the folk traditional.

It isn't known who wrote the song, but it's lore was personified when it was falsely alleged that Frankie sang these words as she was about to be executed.

Comedic song about a man's grandmother dying at the age of 83 and only leaving him this \"old arm chair\".  His siblings scorned him for it, but at the end of the song the chair broke and inside it he found lots of money his grandmother had stashed away for him, so he got the last laugh telling them \"don't you wish you had the old arm chair\". The authorship is uncertain. In 1880, two songs with identical lyrics were published in NYC, one by Frank B. Carr (no info. available) as \"Grandma's Old Arm-Chair\" and one by John Read (who had published other songs around the same time frame) as \"Grandmother's Chair\". So, Read is the more likely author of the two.  Interestingly, the song references \"pounds\" (i.e., British money) instead of \"dollars\", which would imply a Brit might have written the song.  Some actually attribute this to the British poet Eliza Cook and the tune to Henry Russell. Cook published a poem in 1840 called \"The Old Arm Chair\" but the words to it have no relation to the ones in this song. Given all the uncertainty, SHS is assigning \"Unknown\" for the songwriting credits and naming the song based off the apparent first 1927 releases that were titled \"The Old Arm Chair\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1046471","1046887","1046427","1046426","1046475","1048664","1046622","1046625"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

However, many performances have become intertwined.  For example, Fresno State contradicts Mainly Norfolk and says the Ballad index includes the American variant \"Three Men Went A-Hunting\" songs with the Three Jolly Huntsmen (not Three Drunken Huntsmen), as it doesn't deal with drinking but it does deal with men from three different countries naming the things they have seen. Cyril Tawney's \"The Three Huntsmen\" also doesn't involve getting drunk and the like but Mainly Norfolk has it classified there.
