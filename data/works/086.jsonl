Williams\" and \"Ewing Brooks.\" Kelly Harrell was the first to record \"Charles Guiteau\" in 1927.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1047619","1047589","1077528","1067304","1047587","1068463","1047591","1047586","1047588"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

Afterwards, Colvill complains that his head is aching and he is told that this is an omen of his impending death.  In Lady Alice, Clerk Colvill (who is now known as Giles Collins), has died and Lady Alice is mourning her loss.  In many of the stories Lady Alice sees his ghost and says she will be dead the next day to join him. The song, George Collins (which is usually how it's known in America), combines the two stories with more emphasis on the Lady Alice ending, Kelly Harrell sang the story of George Collins as \"Dying Hobo\" on June 9, 1926, but he added this first verse of lyrics involving a dying hobo - A way out west on a water tank One cold December day An' in the empty car box A dying hobo laid Dick Justice covered Harrell's version as \"One Cold December Day\" with more floating verses.

But his train is wrecked, \"derailed by an open switch.\" Blake's last message to his wife says they'll meet in heaven. Train wreck-related tragedy song apparently was derived from an article or story published in a 1910 railroad magazine.  At some point the words from this story reached Carson Robison and he arranged them and set them to music and the song was copyrighted as \"Jim Blake\".  Pete Condon is the copyrighted  lyricist so he likely was involved with the initial 1910 publication or just took credit for it.  Robison's compatriot, Vernon Dalhart, recorded it on May 21, 1927 for Brunswick as \"Jim Blake, the Engineer\".  The recording was assigned Brunswick catalog 173 but went unissued.  He then recorded it as just \"Jim Blake\" on August 26, 1927, and it was released on multiple labels. In 1930, Monroe Lamb & Frank Wheeler recorded it as \"Jim Blake, the Engineer\" and registered it as their own original.  The Carter Family recorded it in 1937 as \"Jim Blake's Message\", and A.P. Carter did likewise, even though both renditions were essentially the same song that Dalhart first recorded\/released.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1048312","1048629","1048632","1048308","1048311","1048324"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

The trio were cotton mill workers in Belmont, North Carolina.  Their storyline says if you are black man and in Belmont for long, you will end up arrested and working on a chain gang.  It has this chorus - Big ni**er, won't you roll down the line? Roll down the line. Yonder comes my darlin', roll down line. (Keep it rollin') Won't you roll down the line? (Roll on) Roll down the line. Yonder comes my darlin', roll down line. Uncle Dave Macon recorded a song called \"Buddy Won't You Roll down the Line\" in July 1928 and credited himself. However, upon listening to both versions, it is apparent they are are related.  Either Macon borrowed heavily from the Watts and Wilson song and changed the setting to the Tennessee coal mines or more likely there was an earlier version that Watts\/Wilson adapted to their Belmont setting.  The tune of both songs is essentially the same and so is the refrain (but instead of \"ni**er\", he used \"buddy\").  Pete Seeger's 1956 \"Roll down the Line\" is also another clear example of the similarities.  His album says it's from 1890 so there is likely an original work that needs to be located. Seems the earliest recorded version of this traditional sung for noted folksong collector Robert Winslow Gordon by William H. Stevens at Biltmore \u2013 a suburb of Asheville, NC, on Nov. 26, 1925, as \"Convict Song\" (about black prisoners used as \"involuntary scabs\" in coal mines against organized labor \u2013 presumably based on the Coal Creek troubles 1876-'77): CHORUS: O buddy, won't yer roll down the line, Hop down, skip down, Well, yonder comes my darlin' Rollin' down the line.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1048900","1057885"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

It tells the story of two valiant heroes\u2014the titular Abdulla, fighting for the Turks, and his foe (originally named Ivan Potschjinsky Skidar in French's version), a Russian warrior\u2014who encounter one another, engage in verbal boasting, and are drawn into a duel in which both perish.  The song was popularized throughout the music halls and altered by the various performers.  French's actual song title was \"Abdulla Bulbul Ameer\", but probably due to a misunderstanding of the foreign names, by the time it was recorded it was called \"Abdul Abulbul Amir\", and that's how it's known today.  The song became so popular that it was adapted in 1941 into an MGM cartoon, Abdul the Bulbul-Ameer, \"The sons of the Prophet are brave men and bold And quite unaccustomed to fear, But the bravest by far!

Sturgis \"Songs from the Hills of Vermont\", P. 40.  The same song was again published  in Cecil J. Sharp's 1921 \"Nursery Songs from the Appalachian Mountains\", this time called \"The Bird Song\".  Each paragraph in the song involves a different form of bird (blackbird, blue jay, leather winged bat, dove, woodpecker, owl, swallow, hawk, crow, and robin) in a rhyming scheme about courtship and love.  It is now considered a nursery rhyme.  The song had so many verses it didn't lend itself to recording and had to be shortened.  In August 1941, Burl Ives released a pared down version he called \"Leather Winged Bat\" with the leather winged bat as the first bird, then woodpecker and bluebird, and so the \"Leather Winged Bat\" (or \"Leatherwing Bat\") is now typically how the song is known.  But again, depending on the type of birds chosen, the song can be known by many names but always involves the same \"courtship\" (or the failure of it) themes.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["119388","1049284","1049282","1049302","1054549","1054042","1049347","1053888","1049348","1049309","1049281","1052795","1049285","1049369","1050808","1049341","1049371","1053392","1049429","1049298","1049374","1049389","1081441"],"submission_ids":["226968","226970"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

The man kills a wether (castrated male sheep), skins it, and wraps her in it. He declares that he cannot beat her, but he can certainly beat a wether's skin. She recants her refusal and works. The American and British Isles versions have regionalized lyrics but tell the same story.

Geoghegan (though he likely learned it from others). The song shares the same tune as the one for the 1863 American Civil War song When Johnny Comes Marching Home . Which tune predated the other is in dispute, but the American song was published first and both tunes are just credited as \"Traditional\". SHS is setting up \"Johnny I Hardly Knew Ye\" as a musical adaptation of \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\" in order to capture the fact that they share the same tune, but again, some might argue the order should be reversed, and the reality is the tune isn't original to either song.  Lyrically the two songs are unrelated other than both involve war. The American song is a patriotic song about celebrating the eventual return of our soldiers from battle, while the UK song only addresses the suffering aspect of war. Originally seen as humorous, the song today is considered a powerful anti-war song. Except for an initial framing stanza, the song is a monologue by an Irish woman who meets her former lover on the road to Athy, which is located in County Kildare, Ireland. After their illegitimate child was born, the lover ran away and became a soldier. He was badly disfigured, losing his legs, his arms, his eyes and, in some versions, his nose, in fighting on the island of \"Sulloon\", or Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka), and will have to be put in (or, in some versions, with) a bowl to beg. In spite of all this, the woman says, she is happy to see him and will keep him on as her beau. Modern versions often end with an anti-war affirmation.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"When Johnny Comes Marching Home written by [Traditional] , Patrick Gilmore","adapted_from_id":"141773","performance_ids":["1535324","1049797","1049794","409525","1049795","1336181","1049808","1282024","1049772","1064275","1064397","1287601","691435","676980","676973","619644","1049807","1035493","1049820","1049804"],"submission_ids":["285021","252644","275754"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":"99660"}

It was originally performed as a comedic minstrel song telling the tale a young man named Peter Gray (or Johnny Grey) from Pennsylvan-i-a who loved a girl and was to be married.  Her father found out and sent her away out \"west\" (the Ohio Valley).  Peter (Johnny) is distraught and decides to go out west to \"make his fortune\" and is never heard from again. Uncle Dave Macon recorded the song as \"Johnny Grey\" on January 26, 1938 with the same less serious tone of the old minstrel song. When Burl Ives recorded it as \"Peter Gray\" in March 1941, he removed any comedic conotation and turned it into a more somber folk ballad.  Typically covers now will follow suit, with \"Johnny Grey (Gray)\" being more comedic, and \"Peter Gray\" being more grave.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1050165","1050138","1050140","1050139","1067599","1050151"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

The \"Two Soldiers\" is an American Civil War ballad written by an unknown author in the 1860s purportedly inspired by the 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg, where General Lee's Confederates trounced General Burnside's Union troops. The song was apparently well-known in its time.  Many decades later Alan Lomax recorded two takes (1555B & 1556A) of Monroe Gevedon of Kentucky in 1937 singing this song but went unissued at the time. In the late 1950s, Willard \"Uncle Wilie\" Johnson (of the Brady Snifters) obtained a copy of the second take and Mike Seeger learned it and recorded it in 1964 and other performers followed Mike's rendition.  The song starts \"It was just a blue-eyed Boston boy, His voice was low with pain, I'll do your bidding, comrade mine, If I ride back again. But if you ride back, and I am dead, You'll do as much for me, My mother, you know, must hear the news, So write to her tenderly.\" Now the rest of the story.  The song seemed to start in the middle of the story.  In the 1970s Jon Pakake (also of the Brady Snifters) obtained the first take that Lomax had recorded and sure enough, here was the entire song.  However, by this time, the version Mike Seeger had initially released was too well known, so very few renditions ever capture the entire song, plus it would make for a very long song.  Gevedon's second take that also starts out with the Boston Boy line was finally released in 1995, but not his original recording with the full lyrics.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1050417","1050174","1050183","1050175","1050182","1050184","1050445","1050729","1050187","1058756","1058749","1104017","1050211","1066068","1101393","1050181","1058750"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

The authorship of \"The Cowboy's Dream\" has been ascribed to many people. Dominick J. O'Malley (1867-1943) is one of them and he recalls that \"Sweet By-and-By Revised\" was one of his earliest attempts at verse making. He believes it probably was the third or fourth poem of the forty or more that he wrote while following the cowpuncher\u2019s trade. The original, which he says appeared in the Stock Growers\u2019 Journal during the middle 1880\u2019s, is a rather crude set of verses, only five in number. O'Malley credited another puncher, Tom Phelps, with the idea for the verses. \"Tom was singing 'Sweet By and By' most of the time. He had a habit of closing a verse with, `I wonder if ever a cowboy will get to that Sweet By and By'. This gave me the idea for the poem.\" According to the website Cowboy Poetry, O'Malley's verses are: SWEET BY AND BY REVISED Tonight as I lay on the prairie Looking up at the stars in the sky I wonder if ever a cowboy Will go to that sweet by and by. For the trail to that bright mystic region Is both dim and narrow, so they say While the broad one that leads to perdition Is posted and blazed all the way. Now I wonder whose fault that so many Will be lost at the great final day When they might have been rich and had plenty If they had known of the dim narrow way. I hear there will be a grand round-up, When the cowboys, like others, will stand To be cut by the riders of judgment Who are posted and know every brand. Then perhaps there may be a stray cowboy, Unbranded, unclaimed by none nigh, To be mavericked by the riders of judgment, And shipped to the sweet by- and- by. Another person claiming autorship is Will Croft Barnes (1858-1936), who first heard \"Cowboy's Sweet By and By\" in 1886-1887 \"I first heard this song in 1886 or '87 on the Hash Knife range in northern Arizona. A half-breed Indian boy from southern Utah sang about four verses, which he had picked up from some other singers. He knew nothing of their authorship. I wrote these four out in my calf-branding book one evening. Later on a boy from down the Pecos way drifted into our camp and sang the four with slight variations, with two new ones, one of which he claimed as his own work. I wrote another and eventually picked up three more, until I finally had ten verses in all. With the idea of using it as the motif for a cowboy story, I rewrote two or three verses, changed the words of several, added the chorus, and cut the ten down to six verses. With these revisions it was published in Cosmopolitan Magazine, August 1895; \"The Stampede on the Turkey Track Range\" He said that he added the \"Roll On\" chorus, but didn't use it in the story. Here are W.C. Barnes verses THE COWBOY'S SWEET BY AND BY Tune: My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean Last night as I lay on the prairie And gazed at the stars in the sky I wondered if ever a cowboy Would drift to that sweet by and by. The trail to that bright, mystic region Is narrow and dim so they say, But the one that leads down to perdition Is staked and blazed all the way. They say there'll be a great round-up, Where cowboys, like dogies, will stand, To be cut by those riders from Heaven, Who are posted and know every brand. I wonder was there ever a cowboy Prepared for that great judgment day, Who could say to the boss of the riders, I am ready to be driven away. They say He will never forsake you, That he notes every action and look, But for safety you'd better get branded, And have your name in His great tally-book. For they tell of another great owner Who is nigh overstocked, so they say, But who always makes room for the sinner Who strays from that bright, narrow way.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"My Bonnie written by","adapted_from_id":"21959","performance_ids":["1100020","1096237","1055555","1096794","1096584","1385447","1491125","1055249","1054647","1052634","1224412","1096768","1052633","1078046","1078341","1096355","1094709","1129980","1099435","1070515","1056169","1052632"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":"2"}

According to legend, the song was used by a conductor of the Underground Railroad, called Peg Leg Joe, to guide some fugitive slaves. While the song may possibly refer to some lost fragment of history, the origin and context remain a mystery. \"Follow the Drinking Gourd\" was collected by H. B. Parks, an entomologist and amateur folklorist, in the 1910s.

Todo el tiempo quiero estar enamorado y sin embargo no s\u00e9 d\u00f3nde est\u00e1s. Todo el tiempo quiero tenerte a mi lado y sin embargo no s\u00e9 qui\u00e9n ser\u00e1s. Todo el tiempo quiero estar enamorado y sin embargo no s\u00e9 d\u00f3nde est\u00e1s. Spanish version lyrics Puedo imaginar tu voz, cuando cantas mi canci\u00f3n, Con ingenuidad? Puedo imaginar tambi\u00e9n, el aroma de tu piel, Y suspirar? Yo quiero que me encuentres ahora, Saber que mi destino mejora, Sentir que nuestra oculta armon\u00eda, Pueda existir. Todo el tiempo quiero estar enamorado Y sin embargo no se d\u00f3nde estas. Todo el tiempo quiero tenerte a mi lado y sin embargo, No se qui\u00e9n ser\u00e1s. Eres dulce sensaci\u00f3n, nuevo sue\u00f1o de pasi\u00f3n y realidad. Tantas veces te busqu\u00e9, Tantas otras te encontr\u00e9? En mi soledad. Yo quiero que seas siempre mi amante, Gozar con tu amor cada instante. Dejar que esta tenue locura, Me haga vivir. Todo el tiempo quiero estar enamorado, Y sin embargo no se donde estas. Todo el tiempo quiero tenerte a mi lado, Y sin embargo no se quien ser\u00e1s.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"\u00bfQu\u00e9 hago en Manila? written by Federico Moura , Julio Moura -\n                            Spanish version","adapted_from_id":"228540","performance_ids":["1055929"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"53130","managed_by":null}
