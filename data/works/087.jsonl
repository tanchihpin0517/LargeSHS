Their lamps are flickering, their food is almost gone; they say farewell to their wives and children, saying they will meet them in heaven. Coal Creek, northwest of Knoxville TN, is a tributary of the Clinch River, and mining led to the founding of a town with the same name, along with two others, Fraterville and Briceville. On Monday, May 19, 1902, the Fraterville coal miners had just started work when a massive methane explosion sealed off the mine. It took four days to reach them, by which time all 216 had died. Fraterville was left with only three adult males who had not gone to work that day, along with hundreds of widows and a thousand orphans. Some of the miners had participated in the 1891 rebellion to regain their jobs.  In 1929, a Kentuckian named Green Bailey recorded this song, which most likely was penned shortly after the explosion.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1061564","1061535","1061533","1061532","1061530","1061540","1061539"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

This is a parody of Stephen Foster's 1854 song \"Hard Times Come Again No More\" and uses the same tune. During the U.S. Civil War, the soldiers severely wanted for enough good and edible food.  They were mainly provided field rations of a very hard biscuit cracker known as \"hardtack\" that was difficult to chew and very hard on their teeth. This song is often attributed to Josiah Fowler of the Union's First Iowa Infantry dating to just after the Battle of Boonville, June 1861, but there isn't definitive evidence of this. 'Tis the song, the sigh of the hungry \"Hard tack, hard tack, come again no more.\" Many days have you lingered upon our stomachs sore.

The lyrics came from a cowboy poem published in 1885 called \"The Cowboy's Soliloquy\".  The song was first recorded by Carl T. Sprague for Victor on August 24, 1927. On his release he said he learned the lyrics from John A. Lomax's 1910 book, Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads.  Lomax created a tune for the song when he published his 1910 book, but Sprague apparently used his own melody for much of his performance (and credited himself on his release). When Lomax updated his book he added Sprague's melody as a alternative work. SHS is crediting both Lomax and Sprague for the musical component out of an abundance of caution.

The lyrics came from a cowboy poem first published annonymously in the October 30, 1886 edition of the Socurro Bullion (Socurro, New Mexico) newspaper. The song was first recorded by Carl T. Sprague for Victor on August 24, 1927. On his release he said he learned the lyrics from John A. Lomax's 1910 book, Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads. Lomax created a tune for the song when he published his 1910 book, but Sprague apparently used his own melody (and credited himself on his release). SHS is crediting both Lomax and Sprague for the musical component out of an abundance of caution.

The release credited Maggie Andrews for the songwriting credits, which was a pseudonym used by Dalhart's collaborator, Carson Robison.  The opening line is \"In a little village churchyard...\".  There was a song named \"In a Little Village Churchyard\" apparently first printed in Elder John R. Daily's 1918 Primitive Baptist Hymn and Tune Book, so Robison likely lifted the lyrics to his song from the hymn book.  The earliest recordings called \"In a Little Village Churchyard\" were by The Carter Family's and J.E. Mainer's Mountaineers in 1937.  They both credited themselves on their releases.  In 1971 the Stanley Brothers resurrected the song as \"Village Church Yard\" and Ralph Stanley registered his version.  Roscoe Holcomb recorded the song in 1972 and released his in 1975 as \"The Village Churchyard\".  His extensive song notes say he learned it from \"The New Baptist Song Book (Song No. 27)\".  The lyrics to all of the versions over the years are substantially the same. In a dear old village churchyard There I see a grassy (or mossy) mound That is where my mother's sleeping In the cold and silent ground There in a weeping willow Sweet little bird to sing at dawn It's I've no one left to love me Since my mother's dead and gone","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1105791","1071105","1070859","1070864","1070846","1105783","1105782","1070847","1070866","1070849","1070851","1070867"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

There were no authorship credits on their release. Bill Carlisle recorded his version almost three years later and credited himself, and his name is typically associated with the song. The Sweet Brothers (aka Prairie Ramblers) also recorded a version in 1939 with no authorship credits on their release.  The Maddox Brothers and Rose recorded it in 1949 for 4Star and their release had no authorship credits.  Rose released a solo version in 1960 and it was credited to W.S. Stevenson (who owned the 4Star label she had originally recorded the song for). Various others have registered the song over the years (even Rose Maddox) but it seems unlikely that Carlisle wrote the song given that Cox and Hobbs recorded their song three years prior, plus Carlisle doesn't have a registry for the song.
