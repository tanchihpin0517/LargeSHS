However, the waltz began as a song air, originally written and composed by William J. Scanlan (1856-1898), and published in 1881. In the original, the verse is in duple time and the chorus is in waltz time. The earliest release of \"Peek-A-Boo\" dates back to at least Will Oakland's 1911 Columbia recording. Ernest Stoneman & Kahle Brewer recorded an instrumental waltz version in 1926 and on their Victor release it was titled Peek-A-Boo with the extension \"- Waltz\" to denote the style of the recording.  Thereafter, it became popular as a waltz tune with the mistaken title of \"Peek-A-Boo Waltz\". The words to the chorus are: Peek-a-boo, Peek-a-boo, Come from behind the chair; Peek-a-boo, Peek-a-boo, I see you hiding there.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1075809","1075802","1075800","1075790","1075805","1075789","1093412","1089399","1094030","1075806","1098037"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

The songs on the album were purportedly unfinished lyrics by Woody Guthrie that his family found and asked Bragg to complete and record.  Jeff Tweedy (of Wilco) was credited on the music component of the album's songs.  This was one of those songs.  However, in 1964, Ramblin' Jack Elliott recorded Woody Guthrie's \"At My Window\" with very similar lyrics.  Elliott's song At My Window went unreleased until 2000 on his Best of the Vanguard Years . Elliott's song does differ musically from the Mermaid Avenue recording, so in order to document the convoluted history behind this work, SHS is assigning Tweedy's musical credit as an adaptation.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"At My Window [Sad and Lonely] written by Woody Guthrie","adapted_from_id":"241817","performance_ids":["1077350"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

It is more familiarly known as \"Drunkard's Doom\" after the Louvin Brothers 1960 performance on their landmark album Satan Is Real.  The actual songwriters are unknown. \"The Drunkard's Hell\" was published in John A. Lomax's 1910 book Cowboy Ballads, and Other Frontier Songs, P. 395.  Vernon Dalhart's 1925 release credited Knoles - Jeffries - Jenkins (Jenkins is probably the Rev. Jenkins credited on the flip-side Kinnie Wagner). Most of the ensuing performances usually credited themselves or traditional since it was in the public domain. As stated above this song can be named \"Drunkard's Dream\".   There is another work on SHS called The Drunkard's Dream that has performances from the 1920s that begin \"Oh don't you look much better now your clothes are neat and clean..\" There is another similarly themed song first recorded in 1928 by Ted Chesnut called The Drunkard's Doom that is typically known as I Saw a Man at the Close of Day after Grayson & Whitter's 1929 recording.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1078639","1078732","1078652","1078901","1078640","1078755","1078763","1078641","1027323","1078753","1078642"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":["15649","15649"],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

The Squirrel Hunters was the name for a group of civilians who assisted regular federal forces in defending Cincinnati, Ohio from a Confederate attack in 1862. Samuel Bayard (1908-1997) collected the tune named for these irregulars along the Ohio border in southwestern Pennsylvania. Bayard mostly heard The Squirrel Hunters tune from fifers. In his tune book, \u201cDance to the Fiddle, March to the Fife\u201d (The Pennsylvania State University Press: 1982), he labels the many variants of the piece as having a long history in the British Isles and Ireland.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1086659","1086658","1092385","1086660","1086662","1240287"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

Convicted on circumstantial evidence and the testimony of his sister-in-law who was living with them at the time, Coleman was tried in nearby Cumberland County and sentenced to death to be hanged on May 24, 1847. While being driven to the place of execution in a two-wheeled ox cart, Coleman sat on his coffin and played a tune that has come down as \"Coleman's March.\" Coleman protested his innocence to the last, and several stories exist of a man confessing, or of \"an old lady confessing on her death-bed she had killed Coleman's wife.\" One account (in the Burkesville Almanac) gives that Coleman's relatives quickly recovered the body, somehow managed to revive him and put him on a steamboat down the Cumberland River to Nashville, from which point he disappeared into the West. Also attached to the tune is the legend that before Coleman was hanged he offered his fiddle to anyone who could play the tune as well as he, and at least one source identified a Kentucky fiddler named Franz Prewitt as the recipient. \"Coleman's March\" seems to be derived from an old Irish tune, The Jaunting Car, which is the tune used in The Bonnie Blue Flag ","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1087424","1087394","1087452","1094678","1087365","1087373","1087364","1087367","1089241","1094657","1425704","1087484","1087376","1087415"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}

Description - A (foreign soldier) is greeted by a pretty Indian lass named Mohee. She offers to take him into her tribe if he will marry her. He will not stay as he has a sweetheart at home. Returning home, he finds his girl has left him, and wishes himself back with Little Mohee. As I was a-walkin' upon a fine day I got awful lonesome as the day passed away I sat down a-musing, alone on the grass When who should sit by me but a sweet Indian lass. The tune of \"Little Mohee\" was collected by the American fieldworkers Loraine Wyman and Howard Brockway in Pine Mountain, Kentucky on May 8, 1916 from a singer named Mary Ann Bagley, and published by them in 1916, in their collection Lonesome tunes, song ballets and love songs of the Kentucky Mountains. Only 2 months later, July 29, 1916, the same tune, as sung by Miss Memory Shelton at Alleghany, N.C., this time coupled with the lyrics of \" On Top of Old Smokey \" was collected by Cecil Sharp in his collection English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1088391","1088340","1088390","1088388","1088342","1088345","1088329","1088346","1489418","1088369","1088360","1088332","1088336","1090974","1375663"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"72827","managed_by":null}
