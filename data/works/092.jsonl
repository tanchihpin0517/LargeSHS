It opens with these lyrics \"At first she's gonna come on strong, like she'll love you all night long, like it's going out of style, then she'll leave you with a smile\". George Strait had previously released an unrelated song with the exact same title written by Jackson Leap on his 1997 album Carrying Your Love with Me.
