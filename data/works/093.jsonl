English: \"The Hope\") is a 19th century Jewish poem and the national anthem of Israel. Its lyrics are adapted from a poem by Naftali Herz Imber. He wrote the first version of the poem in 1877, while he was a guest of a Jewish scholar in Ia\u0219i, Romania. The theme of the romantic composition reflects the Jews' 2,000-year-old hope of returning to the Land of Israel, restoring it, and reclaiming it as a free and sovereign nation.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["964388","1234779","1235888","1234097","1233732","1223762","1234224","1305739","1231114","1237685"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Poem","added_by":"53130","managed_by":null}
