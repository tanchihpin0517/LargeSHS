It starts \"I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night, alive as you and and me\". With the next line being \"But I said, Joe, you're ten years dead\" and Joe Hill having been executed in November 1915, the lyrics will actually have been written in very late 1925 or very early 1926, though. Ten years later, Earl Robinson set the poem to music and christened it \"Joe Hill\".

The music is the hymn \"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\", written in 1797 by the Austrian composer Joseph Haydn as an anthem for the birthday of Francis II, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and later of Austria. In 1841, the German linguist and poet August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote the lyrics of \"Das Lied der Deutschen\" as a new text for that music, counterposing the national unification of Germany to the eulogy of a monarch, lyrics that were considered revolutionary at the time. Along with the flag of Germany, which first appeared in its essentially \"modern\" form in 1778, it was one of the symbols of the March Revolution of 1848. The song used to be known by the beginning of the first stanza, \"Deutschland, Deutschland \u00fcber alles\" (\"Germany, Germany above all\"). After WW II, the third became the official anthem.

The lyrics are from a waka poem written by an unnamed author in the Heian period (794\u20131185) and the current melody was chosen in 1880. The court musician, Hayashi Hiromori (1831\u201396), is nominally credited with the melody, which was given its premiere in 1880 and has remained the national anthem since that time.\"Kimigayo\" is usually translated as \"His Imperial Majesty's Reign\". Sources conflict over who actually composed the music.  Historian Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney wrote that the composer is usually identified as Hayashi Hiromori but Oku Yoshiisa, who worked under Hayashi, is believed to have composed the music, with some rearrangement by Eckert.   The melody that Hayashi was credited for replaced an arrangement by Fenton, the visiting military band leader, that was rejected in 1870. The Court then adopted a new melody composed by Yoshiisa Oku and Akimori Hayashi. The composer is often listed as Hiromori Hayashi, who was their supervisor and Akimori\u2019s father. Akimori was also one of Fenton\u2019s pupils.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Kimigayo [National Anthem of Japan] written by","adapted_from_id":"260827","performance_ids":["1224003","1234101","1236555","1236508","1224004","1234228","1230777"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}
