Authorship of the music is disputed and often attributed to Mozart.  Nineteen days before his death on 5 December 1791, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed his last complete work, the Freimaurerkantate, K. 623. In parts of the printed edition of this cantata there appeared the song K. 623a \"Lasst uns mit geschlungnen H\u00e4nden\" (\"Let us with joined hands\"). To this melody the Austrian national anthem is sung. Today, Mozart's authorship is regarded as dubious and the song is attributed to Johann Holzer [de] (either solely or co-authored with Mozart) or Paul Wranitzky. Before the World War II Anschluss, Austria's state anthem was \"Sei gesegnet ohne Ende\", set to the tune of Haydn's \"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\", the state anthem of imperial Austria since 1797. The current German national anthem \"Deutschlandlied\" uses the same tune, but with different words (it was also the co-national anthem of Germany during National Socialist rule). To avoid the association, and because singing it was banned for a time after the war, a new state anthem was created. The lyrics were written by Paula von Preradovi\u0107, one of the few women to have written lyrics for a national anthem.   On 22 October 1946, the song was officially declared Austria's national anthem, albeit without words. Lyrics were added in February 1947.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1231215","1235327","1234082","1236543","1236489","1231080","1234215","1231081","1237663"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}

In 1947 the current structure of the musical and lyricial ambiance was overhauled by composer Juan Bautista Plaza.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1235901","1231103","1231104"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}

The anthem's music was originally composed by Alexander Alexandrov in 1938 for the Hymn of the Bolshevik Party.  When the Communist International (Comintern) was dissolved in 1943 in order for the Soviet Union to maintain its alliance with the other Allies of World War II, a new composition was needed to replace \"The Internationale\" as the national anthem. A contest was held in mid to late 1943 for a new anthem, and more than 200 entries were submitted.[5] Alexandrov's music was personally chosen by Stalin, who both praised and criticized it.[6] The anthem's lyrics then had to be written. Stalin thought the song should be short, and that it should invoke the Red Army's impending victory over the forces of Germany on the Eastern Front. The poets Sergey Mikhalkov and Gabriel El-Registan were chosen by Stalin's staffers, called to Moscow, and given the task of writing lyrics which referenced not only the Great Patriotic War, but also \"a Country of Soviets\". The first draft was completed overnight.  The anthem was first published on 7 November 1943. It was played for the first time on Soviet radio at midnight on 1 January 1944, and officially adopted on 15 March the same year.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1231148","1234159","1231216","1234778","1235895","1234258","1234094","1233731","1236494","1231147","1234229","1237696"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}

Despite a popular uproar, the Portuguese government accepted their demands. This contributed to the unpopularity of King Carlos I and the monarchy, and it garnered support for the increasingly popular republican movement in Portugal.  The night after the ultimatum was accepted, composer Alfredo Keil, at the suggestion of a group of friends that included Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro and Te\u00f3filo Braga, wrote the melody for \"A Portuguesa\" as a patriotic protest march.

There are many versions of \"Men of Harlech\", and there is no single accepted English version. The music was first published without words during 1794 as Gorhoffedd Gw\u0177r Harlech\u2014March of the Men of Harlech in the second edition of The Musical and Poetical Relicks of the Welsh Bards, but it is said to be a much earlier folk song. The earliest version of the tune to appear with lyrics, found thus far, comes from a broadside printed c. 1830. Since then, many different versions of the English lyrics have been published. It was published first with Welsh lyrics in Gems of Welsh Melody, edited by the Welsh poet, John Owen (Owain Alaw), published in London, England and Wrexham, Wales, during 1860. An edition containing Welsh and English lyrics was published in Ruthin, Wales, during 1862. The song was published in Volume II of the 1862 collection Welsh Melodies with the Welsh lyrics by the Welsh poet John Jones (Talhaiarn) and the English lyrics by Thomas Oliphant, President of the Madrigal Society. Another source attributes the Welsh words to the poet John Ceiriog Hughes, first published during 1890, and says that English words were first published during 1893, but this is clearly predated by the earlier publications","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1232270","1232316","1232272","1232514","1233117","1232509","1232309","1232267","1232268","1233119","1233114","1233118","1254789"],"submission_ids":["204493","204207"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}

The Brazilian National Anthem (Hino Nacional Brasileiro in Portuguese) was first composed by Francisco Manoel da Silva upon independence from Portugal in 1822, but was not used until 1890. Instead, the first anthem was the Hino da Independ\u00eancia composed by the first emperor, Pedro I.  With the establishment of a republic in 1889, lyrics were written by Joaquim Os\u00f3rio Duque Estrada to go with Francisco Manoel da Silva's song. However, as the lyrics did not fit well with the original music, changes had to be made to it.  When played in its purely instrumental form the original music is used and the anthem is a lot shorter. The unisong-song version (which is the official one) plays a modified version of the music twice (because the lyrics are too extense).\u2014 Excerpted from Brazilian National Anthem on Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1235333","1236548","1235332","1285469","1237666"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}

Diverse publications of the anthem had subtle modifications in the lyrics and the music, which was then restored by Claudio Rebagliati in 1869 at the behest of Alcedo. In 1874 there was a solicitation which asked for a revision to the lyrics of the anthem, in light of the various versions in circulation, as well as the minor mistakes which were found. This initiative was approved, but did not prosper, due to the rejection that it generated in the public opinion at its core and the recognition that it had already become a time honored tradition. In 1901 there was another intent to reform the anthem, this time approved by the administration of Eduardo L\u00f3pez de Roma\u00f1a, who approved of the music of the restored anthem by Rebagliati. He declared a new contest to select new lyrics as he considered the original lyrics as aggressive towards Spain, which at the time had amiable relations with Peru. The winner of the contest was the poet Jos\u00e9 Santos Chocano, whose verses along with the same chorus went on to be sung in public schools and in public venues. The lyrics also had references to the great South American liberator hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar as well as Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn, the nation's founder, in the first verse. It was not long until public opinion once again asked for the original lyrics to be restored. Public pressure was so great that the Peruvian Congress was obligated in 1913 during the administration of Presiden Guillermo Billinghurst to declare untouchable the lyrics as well as the chorus of the National Anthem.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1235906","1235907","1237694"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}

While widely thought to have been composed by Guiseppe Verdi, the anthem first used by the Khedive of Egypt was composed by an Italian, Giuseppe Pugioli. Pugioli (who came to Egypt late in 1871) composed the tune as a way for the soldiers to mark time in step. One day, the Khedieve Ismail Pasha stopped by the barracks when the soldiers were practicing their marching to the beat of Pugioli\u2019s tune. The Khedive was immediately interested in the tune and asked to have it arranged for a brass band to play. It was then decided to make it the Khedivial Anthem. (This was possibly sometime shortly after Pugioli\u2019s arrival in Egypt.) After the monarchy was deposed in 1952, it was still used as the national anthem, only the title was changed to reflect the country\u2019s new status as a republic. In 1958, Egypt entered into a union with Syria known as the United Arab Republic; the anthem of the UAR was this anthem, followed by the Syrian anthem. Despite the Italian nationality of the composer, the anthem is very typical of others used in the area at the time, a classic example of the \u201cArab fanfare\u201d style of anthem.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1236843","1236842"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}

It was written to coincide with the 1874 festivities in honor of one millennium since the Norse first arrived on the island. It is for this reason that the full translation of the anthem's title is \"The Millennial Hymn of Iceland\".  The song was first played on August 2 of that year, at a service celebrated at Reykjav\u00edk Cathedral to commemorate the milestone, with the King of Denmark (and hence, the King of Iceland) \u2013 Christian IX \u2013 in attendance. However, the song was not officially adopted as the country's national anthem until 70 years later in 1944, when Icelanders voted in a referendum to end their state's personal union with Denmark and become a republic.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1237690","1545489","1237689"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"59961","managed_by":null}
