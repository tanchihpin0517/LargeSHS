The song tells of the soul's travel, and the hazards it faces, on its way from earth to purgatory. Descriptions of the song have come from Scotland and from the north of England as far south as Yorkshire. The original poem has been recorded a number of times as a song. Arnold Bax set it for voice and piano in 1908 and made an orchestral version in 1934. Benjamin Britten set it to music as a part of his Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings in 1943, and Igor Stravinsky uses individual verses as interludes between the longer movements in his Cantata on Old English Texts of 1952. In the folk idiom, most versions follow the tune first used by The Young Tradition in 1966.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1289546","1289547","1289588","1289553","1289583","1289907","1289550","1289548","1289599","1289921","1289901","1289568","1289889","1289876"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"1686","managed_by":null}
