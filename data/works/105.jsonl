Dostal dedicated the first version of the air march to the air corps of the Danube monarchy. In terms of music history, Dostal's operetta with the Fliegermarsch from 1912 belongs to the time of the Viennese operetta. During this time, the Viennese operetta had the reputation of mass entertainment, which was later discussed with the term culture industry.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1303110","1303112","1303111"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"9","managed_by":null}
