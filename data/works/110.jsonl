The concerto is scored for solo piano, flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns in C, two trumpets in C, timpani and strings and  has three movements: 1. Allegro maestoso; in common time. The tempo marking is in Mozart's catalog of his own works, but not in the autograph manuscript. 2. Andante in F major. In both the autograph score and in his personal catalog, Mozart notated the meter as alla 3. Allegro vivace assai The second movement was featured in the 1967 Swedish film Elvira Madigan with G\u00e9za Anda as soloist.
