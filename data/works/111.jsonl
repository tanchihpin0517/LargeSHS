This version is in fact the exact same underlying instrumental track as originally recorded by the Latin Blues Band. And also in 1968, a musician by the name of Dave Cortez (a\/k\/a Dave Clowney) recorded an instrumental organ track, which was added to the same \"Happy Soul\" instrumental track. He also added a \"Wah Wah\" guitar line to the brass part. This new recording was titled Happy Soul (with a Hook) and was also released on the Speed label as a single in or around 1969. In 1969, a musician named Harold Beatty composed Hippy Skippy Moon Strut which also uses the exact same brass part, with the added \"Wah Wah\" guitar line from Happy Soul (with a Hook) And then, in 2006, Christina Aguilera sampled the brass and drum part of this song in Ain't No Other Man . Although in the linernotes of her album it says: Contains a sample from \"Hippy Skippy Moon Strut\" written by Harold Beatty and performed by The Moon People. But the sample isn't from \"Hippy Skippy Moon Strut\". otherwise we would have heard the \"Wah Wah\" guitar line, interwoven with the brass part.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1380073"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}
