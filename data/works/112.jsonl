Steffe was born in 1830 in South Carolina. Moving to Philadelphia, PA, he claimed to have composed this tune in 1855 or 1856 with the words, \"Say Bummers, Will You Meet Us\", also with the traditional Glory Hallelujah refrain, for the Goodwill Fire Company of Philadelphia, PA, whose members were known as \"Bummers\". However, it appears that Steffe simply adapted the traditional camp meeting song and wrote a few new words. In 1885, Richard J. Hinton, one of John Brown's biographers, wrote to Steffe asking about the circumstances of the writing of the original song. Steffe's four replies are contained in the archives of the Kansas State Historical Society in Topeka. On December 11th, 1885, Steffe wrote: \"...though I never claimed any notoriety in music I want to prove by the best evidence the origin of the music of the popular song. Those who prompted me to write it are all 'gathered to their fathers' most of those who sang Say Brothers will you meet us-- are 'beyond the river'....\" In his second and third letters, mailed more than a year later, Steffe stated that he sent a copy of the song to Hinton, but that since the copy was not received, it must have gotten lost in the mail. Steffe said he had trouble remembering the circumstances of the writing and was apparently in contact with others in Philadelphia who were present and could have testified that Steffe wrote the song. But Steffe never gave Hinton any verification from these other persons. In the last letter dated March 4, 1887, Steffe finally told the whole story of the writing of the song. He was asked to write it in 1855 or 56 for the Good Will Engine Company of Philadelphia. They used it as a song of welcome for the visiting Liberty Fire Company of Baltimore. The original verse for the song was \"Say, Bummers, Will You Meet Us?\" Someone else converted the \"Say, Bummers\" verse into the hymn \"Say, Brothers, Will You Meet Us.\" He thought he might be able to identify that person, but was never able to do so. He also wrote that he had visited Boston during the Civil War while carrying dispatches from General Butler to Governor Andrew. While there, he attended a review of the \"Tiger\" Battalion. The \"Tigers\" sang \"John Brown's Body,\" and, afterwards, Steffe told them he had originated the tune.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Say Brothers, Will You Meet Us? written by [Traditional]","adapted_from_id":"43760","performance_ids":[],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}

In 1892 he came crawling in from Mexico into Texas, with all of his little friends and relatives. When they'd eaten up Texas they migrated to Louisiana in 1903 and another five years later to Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. Many songs about the boll weevil, with varying tunes and\/or varying lyrics, were recorded by blues musicians during the 1920s through the 1940s. For example this Alabama version of \"Boll Weevil\", recorded by Jaybird Colemen in 1927 and (most famously) by Vera Hall in 1959 (as \"Boll Weevil Holler\") for the Alan Lomax compilation Sounds of the South . Vera Hall had already recorded 2 versions before: in 1940 John Lomax and Ruby Pickens Tartt recorded Vera Hall singing \"Boll Weevil Blues\" and in 1937 John Lomax recorded her singing \" Boll Weevil \".

Don't you b'lieve you'll make a change? I'm 'on make a change, myself. 1933 comes, I'm 'on, I'm gon' quit drinkin' my whiskey and gon' be a bootlegger, so pick 'em, a great long time. Me and you both will make a change, Pine, so pick 'em!) You see my baby, give my babe my best regards (2x) So I'm still in this town, but the times is awful hard Six years later, Jack Kelly and His South Memphis Jug Band recorded the plaintive \u201cBelieve I\u2019ll Go Back Home\u201d. In these early versions, the singer accepts blame for being unfaithful and longs for home, a lyrical sentiment that would continue for a few years, and then disappear with the Robert Johnson and Elmore James recordings. Another ancestor, Carl Rafferty\u2019s \u201cMr. Carl\u2019s Blues\u201d, from 1933, contained the familiar lyrics: \u201cI\u2019m going call up in to China, just to see if my babe\u2019s over there\u201d and \u201cI do believe, I believe I\u2019ll dust my broom\u201d. Other notable pre-war versions were recorded by Josh White, Leroy Carr, and Kokomo Arnold, a slide guitarist whose \u201cSagefield Woman Blues\u201d echoed the \u201cI believe, I believe I\u2019ll dust my broom\u201d line from the Rafferty record. On another 78, \u201c Sissy Man Blues \". Arnold resurrected the China reference. Robert Johnson, arguably the Mississippi Delta\u2019s most skilled blues performer of the 1930s, recycled portions of Arnold\u2019s \u201cSagefield Woman Blues\u201d and \u201c Sissy Man Blues \". In his 1936 recording \u201cI Believe I\u2019ll Dust My Broom\u201d, Johnson played his version in open-E tuning. While he did not use a slide, his high-pitched triplets set the template for future slide versions, and his shuffle bass pattern anticipated how electrified blues bands would arrange the song.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1393881"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}
