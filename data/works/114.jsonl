The inventions are titled \"Inventions\" because they were intended to teach the art of counterpoint and to provide examples of how to create melodies and harmonies that fit together in a pleasing and logical way. Each invention is based on a single main theme, which is presented at the beginning and then developed and varied in the course of the piece. The \"Invention in F major, BWV 779\" is a lively and energetic piece that features a main theme that is presented in the right hand, with a supporting melody in the left hand. It is a great piece for intermediate to advanced pianists to learn, as it helps to develop skills in phrasing, rhythm, and melody.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1406960"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Classical work","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}
