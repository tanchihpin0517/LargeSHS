Like with many traditionals, the origins cannot be defined and are subject to speculations. For example, already poet\/troubadour Walther von der Vogelweide (1170-1230) had a ditty called \"Joch sint iedoch gedanke fr\u00ee\" (Nevertheless, Thoughts Are Still Free\"). The song as known these days was set up by Hoffmann von Fallersleben and published in the 1842 collection \"Schlesische Volkslieder\" (Breitkopf und H\u00e4rtel, Leipzig), but it seems to be based on lyrics and melodies appearing between 1780 and 1820, It has been an anthem of Nazi resistance, student revolts and German non-nationalist student organizations and innumerable local choirs perfom it. In more recent days, right-wing bands and rallies are 'kidnapping' it for their purposes, though.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1426628","1426641","1426634","1490807","1426657","1426326","1426023","1426631","1427632","1495480","1491148","1426027","1504264","1426031","1510281","1426913","1426918","1428933","1458249","1426655","1426037","1426021","1428940","1495273","1426017","1495297"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"50304","managed_by":null}
