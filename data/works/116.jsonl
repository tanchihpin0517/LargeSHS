But his setting is in fact an adaptation of Johann Friedrich Reichardt's 1794 musical setting of Goethe's poem. In April 1858, Brahms sent publisher Rieter-Biedermann a set of 14 Volks-Kinderlieder with specific instructions that they were to be printed without his name! The collection was dedicated to Clara Schumann's children whom Brahms had taken care of during numerous times in D\u00fcsseldorf between 1854 and 1857.  The set saw public light in November 1858 and most certainly subsequent editions did not show Brahms' name until after his death, with the exception of an 1872 edition printed in English.  According to a 1893 letter to Clara, Brahms could not remember at that time when exactly he had arranged these songs, hinting that some of them could even date from before his time with the Schumann children. Three of them are relatively well known among singers: Sandm\u00e4nnchen, Marienw\u00fcrmchen and Wiegenlied, since they appear in some voice anthologies for students (the last one not to be confused with Brahms' world-wide famous Wiegenlied op. 49). In the 1926 Brahms S\u00e4mtliche Werke, the Volks-Kinderlieder appeared in volume XXVI, without the WoO 31 number later assigned to them.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Heidenr\u00f6slein [poem] written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Heidenr\u00f6slein written by Johann Friedrich Reichardt","adapted_from_id":"168334","performance_ids":[],"submission_ids":["199189","199190","233169"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}
