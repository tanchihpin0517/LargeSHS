The pair had been seeing each other for several months when, on Christmas Eve 1900, Moses boasted in Delia's presence about his sexual relationship with her. She denied the sexual relationship, and during their argument called him a \"son-of-a-bitch\". Shortly thereafter, Moses shot Delia, who died on Christmas. Howard Odum collected a fragment of the ballad in Newton, Georgia sometime between 1906 and 1908. It is #59 in the second part of his 1911 collection of African-American secular songs published in the Journal of American Folklore. This version, a three verse fragment called \u201cOne More Rounder Gone\u201d, implies Delia was a prostitute. Newman Ivey White\u2019s 1928 American Negro Folk Songs, includes a five verse variant, \u201cDelie\u201d, collected in 1924 from Frank Goodell of Spartanburg, South Carolina, who reported he learned it sometime between 1900 and 1904. It\u2019s thin on details regarding motive for the murder. White includes two other fragments which may be part of the same song, one from 1915 or 1916 in Alabama and the other from 1919 in North Carolina. Newman Ivey White's \"American Negro Folk Songs\" (1928) also mentions the connection of \"Delia\" with the traditional \" Frankie and Johnny \/Frankie and Albert tune. Early US versions of the song like \"One More Rounder Gone\" and \"Delhia\" were originally accompanied by this traditional \" Frankie and Johnny \/Frankie and Albert tune. But when the song migrated to the Bahamas, new lyrics were added and the tune was also adapted. As early as 1935, Alan Lomax recorded a local version on the Bahamas by The Nassau String Band. Virtually all subsequent versions would use this same form.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Delia written by [Traditional] -\n                            Lyrics Frankie and Johnny written by [Traditional] -\n                            Tune","adapted_from_id":"103032","performance_ids":["1443930","251723","103034","96135"],"submission_ids":["296565"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}
