The schottische is a barndance or couple dance, most likely Scottish in origin. In the early 1800's this dance became popular in Central and Eastern Europe. It took hold among German speaking people, who said schottische, German for scottish. The schottische became a popular ballroom dance in the United States in the 1840's through the influence of dancing masters and dance orchestras as well as the many German-speaking immigrants to the states. The schottische craze in the 1830's and 1840's led to all sorts of  schottisches composed by famous composers and common folk sold as sheet music, performed by cornet bands, orchestras and fiddle bands. Well, the \"Detroit Schottisch\" is one of those compositions.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1451965"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}

John Calhoun, a friend of the lad, composed the verses in 1881 and a local singer, Abraham Munn, set them to a traditional Irish tune. The ballad is the favourite lumbering song of New Brunswick; it also was sung along all the east coast of Canada and in Ontario lumbercamps. The tune is used as the theme of the second movement of Kelsey Jones'Miramichi Ballad. Words to the variant 'Peter Amberlay' were published in W. Roy Mackenzie's Ballads and Sea Songs from Nova Scotia (Cambridge, Mass 1928). A 'Peter Rambelay,' to a different tune, can be found in Helen Creighton's Songs and Ballads from Nova Scotia and has been recorded by Wade Hemsworth (Folk FW-6821) and Alan Mills (RCI 21).","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Tramps and Hawkers written by [Traditional]","adapted_from_id":"240269","performance_ids":["1455769","1455790"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}

I did it while I was hiding from the foreman under a concrete stairway, and I used the inside of a cement bag for note paper. I took it home to my modest flat, stuck it in a drawer and forgot about it. Eighteen months later, when fortune was again smiling in my direction, I found myself, along with two others, running a folk singing club in the Clapham area of London. The folk club was called \u201cThe Crubeen\u201d and I suppose if you are a folk buff, you will remember that it started a lot of the present day trend. If you were a folk singer, then the Crubeen was the place to sing. Most of your present day singers, Irish, English and American, dropped in there to try out their material. A young Dublin ex-army rifleman named Danny Doyle wandered in there one night, I sung Step It Out Mary and later gave him the words, no longer written on the cement bag, but neatly typed on shop paper.

It is about the hills (braes) around Balquhidder near Lochearnhead. The song without accompanying notes, was first published in 1814 in \"Poems and Songs Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect\" by Robert Tannahill. But the name of the accompanying air mentioned is \"The Three Carls o' Buchanan\". In 1816, the song was published as \"Bochuiddar\" or \"Balquhidder\" (song # 77 on page 38) in Captain S. Fraser's \"Collection of Melodies of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland\". As \"Will Ye Go Lassie, Go\" (to the air of \"The Braes o' Balquither\"), it was published in 1821 in Volume 1 of Robert Archibald Smith's \"The Scotish Minstrel a Selection from the Vocal Melodies of Scotland Ancient & Modern\". As \"Let Us Go, Lassie, Go\" (to the air of \"The Three Carls o' Buchanan\"), it was published in 1823 in Volume 4 of Robert Archibald Smith's \"The Scotish Minstrel a Selection from the Vocal Melodies of Scotland Ancient & Modern\".

With four stanzas and three choruses, it is a rather lengthy but energetic wartime tribute. Contrary to what is stated on many sites, the lyrics of this work were not written by John McCrae but by Ives himself. At this point in Ives\u2019 compositional life, he was making regular use of a technique known as patchwork, which consists of the piecing together of segments of borrowed tunes to craft a new composite melody. In this case, Ives strings together text and\/or music from 3 American hymn tunes, mentioned here above. The song was first published by Charles Ives himself in 1922 in 114 Songs , containing 114 of his own compositions, which he had selected, edited, and ordered with great care, and which had never been issued before. In 1942 Ives wrote a revision of this song for use in World War 2, retitled \"They are There!\".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1460994"],"submission_ids":["223908","223931","224202","223937","223935","223938"],"web_cover_ids":["22519","22519","22516","22516","22531","22531","22533","22533","22534","22534"],"type":"Song","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}
