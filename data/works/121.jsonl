Likely being published as \"A Song in Praise of Old English Roast Beef\" in print late in 1734 or early 1735. With the first performance by Leveridge at Covent Garden Theatre on 15 April 1735 : When mighty Roast Beef was the Englishman's food, It ennobled our veins and enriched our blood. Our soldiers were brave and our courtiers were good Oh! the Roast Beef of old England, And old English Roast Beef! But since we have learnt from all-conquering France To eat their ragouts as well as to dance, We're fed up with nothing, but vain complaisance Oh the Rost Beef, &c. The song became hugely popular, due to \"a good tune with a rousing chorus\", as well as catching the mood of the country with its satirical take of contemporary English eating French food rather than the \"good old English roast beef\". Over the ensuing 250 years the song has become a strongly patriotic & nationalistic song, being embedded in both the UK navy, as well as the USA marines and army.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"When Mighty Roast Beef written by Henry Fielding","adapted_from_id":"295218","performance_ids":["1473792","1473799"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"99660","managed_by":null}

First appearing in the \"Songs of the North\" (1885 - 1926), it is believed that Sir Boulton translated the words from Gaelic into English. The original song is unknown.
