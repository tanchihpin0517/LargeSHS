The english spelling changed to Sevastopol since the first publication in the 1860's. The original score was titled \"Sebastopol: A descriptive fantaisie\" Intended as a military march, to imitate the bugle and band. It was scored for many instruments, including piano, banjo, and brass band, however guitar & bugle were the first intended instruments from the original sheet music published in 1860. The song was a popular parlor composition during the mid 1800's. The sheet music for guitar gives the tuning for \"Sebastopol\" as D A D F# A D, with the instruction to \"Finger as if tuned in the ordinary manner\" - Mudcat Cafe The open tuning had become one of the most played pieces for solo guitar in nineteenth & early twentieth century America, with open D and along with Spanish tuning were the most popular amongst chord and slide guitarists. By the 1920's the song was known by many different names, most corrupting \"Sebastopol\" by dropping the first syllable including Vestopol, Vastopol, Bestapol, etc. With song now referring to the open D tuning rather than the tune itself.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":[],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"99660","managed_by":null}
