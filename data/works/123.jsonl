In fokelore a worm is often used to describe snakes, serpents and dragons. The Lambton Worm recounts the story of young Lambton, the heir to the Lambton Estate, who, instead of attending church, caught a peculiar eel-like creature with a dragon's head while fishing in the River Wear. Unaware of the creature's potential, he discarded it down a well, ultimately unleashing a monstrous and ravenous worm upon the region. After many years and a transformation, Lambton returns from a crusade, seeking a way to vanquish the beast. With the guidance of a wise woman, he confronts the worm in the River Wear, donning armor studded with razors. The battle ends with the worm's demise, relieving the terrified locals. However, Lambton's omission to fulfill the witch's advice brings a curse upon his family for nine generations, ensuring they don't die peacefully in their beds. The song was first performed as part of a pantomime performed at The Tyne Theatre & Opera House in 1867.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1492206","1492205","1492216","1492207","1492203"],"submission_ids":["204434","204455","204440","204435","204436","204447","204443","204442","204432","204433","204451","204438","204457","204431","204456","204453","204454","204452","204458"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"99660","managed_by":null}

The milkman admires Polly's beauty and longs for her affection but is ultimately rejected when he proposes marriage. Polly demands a wealthier and more impressive suitor, leading the milkman to leave in sadness. In the end, Polly marries a less prestigious man, a bow-legged conductor of a tuppenny bus.
