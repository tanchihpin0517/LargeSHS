Some believe that the Meditations were a forgery. A versified form of some of these meditations entitled \"Ad perennis vitae fontem\" was made in Latin by Cardinal Peter Damian (c. 988-1072). An old English translation appeared in a British manuscript dating to the sixteenth century, from around 1580 or so, and titled, \"A Song made by F. B. P.\", which some think may stand for \"Francis Baker, Priest\". Another well-known hymn, \"Jerusalem, My Happy Home\" as arranged by Joseph Bromehead (and others), was taken from this same source. The section beginning, \"O Mother Dear, Jerusalem\", was arranged by William Prid in 1585, and further altered to its present form by David DIckson (1583-1663). Around 1885 Samuel Augustus Ward especially wrote a melody Materna for \"O Mother Dear, Jerusalem\", altough it had been coupled with other melodies before.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":[],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Poem","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}

An employee of Ward\u2019s music store said that in 1882, while Ward was crossing New York Harbor after a day\u2019s outing at Coney Island, the composer jotted the melody down on his cuff and it was later sung at Grace Episcopal Church. However, Ward\u2019s son-in-law, Henry W. Armstrong, stated that the tune was composed in memory of Ward\u2019s oldest daughter, Clara, who died in 1885. In any event, the tune was first published in a periodical, The Parish Choir, vol. VIII, no. 378 (July 12, 1888), p. 1510.
