It may have been inspired by the war of the Jacobite rising of 1715 (John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll was the loyalist war leader and many Scottish loyalists were Campbells); According to Lewis Winstock the tune accompanied the Scottish loyalist vanguard in the Jacobite war, and Robert Wodrow ascribes that name to one of the bagpipe tunes that accompanied Argyle's Highlanders entrance into Perth and Dundee. Or it may have been concerned with earlier events around the deposing of Mary Queen of Scots. If so, \"Lochleven\" would presumably refer to Lochleven Castle where Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned in 1567, and \"Great Argyll\" may refer to Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll who attempted to rescue her. The song is commonly attributed to Robert Burns, like many Scottish songs which are actually traditional or of unknown origin. Burns did write a version with some different verses, which he published in vol 3 of the Scots Musical Museum, a collection of Scottish folk songs (published in 1790).","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1522522","1522483","1521114"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}
