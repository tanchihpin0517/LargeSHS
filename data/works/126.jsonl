AFRS recordings were made by African-American artists to showcase their music to the United States Armed Forces and allied nations; they weren't meant for commercial release. Dixon is credited as the songwriter for the record, but shortly after, singer Helen Humes released the song under the title Be-Baba-Leba (Philo 106). Humes is credited as the songwriter on her record which became a hit single although Dixon had been performing it on her act since 1942. Later in 1945, Dixon recorded \"E-Bob-O-Le-Bob\" with the Flennoy Trio. The copyright controversy was noted in Billboard (January 26, 1946), when Humes' version was hot on the chart. Only a few months later the song was rewritten by Lionel Hampton to Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop But in fact all these versions were via Boogie Woogie a rewrite of Clarence Smith 's Pine Top's Boogie Woogie .","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1530072","1530475"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}

Its words are in Haitian Creole. Besides the fact that Oswald Durand was a poet and a writer, he also had problems with justice. In 1883, he went to jail, because of his politic ideas. During his time in jail, he wrote his famous poem Choucoune. Durand's inspiration for the poem was a marabou woman named Marie Noel Belizaire\u2014nicknamed Choucoune\u2014who ran a restaurant in Cap-Ha\u00eftien. She met Durand, and the two had a romantic liaison. In the poem, Choucoune deserts the poet for a Frenchman's favors. Reportedly the real Choucoune and Durand parted because of the poet's serial philandering. The poem was apparently first titled: \"Fr\u00e8 p'tit Pierre.\" The poem itself remained unpublished until 1896. Michel Mauleart Monton an American-born pianist with a Haitian father and American mother, composed the music for the poem in 1893, appropriating some French and Caribbean fragments to create his tune. Years later the song was rewritten in English as Yellow Bird based on the words \"ti zwazo\" (French: petits oiseaux; little birds) from the Durand poem.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":[],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Poem","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}

His balloon act was part of \"Stickney and Donovan's Great American Circus\" which toured the Caribbean in 1889, first in Martinique. In the French island (presumably at St Pierre, on the Savannah, by the Fort), a wind squall disrupted his first attempt. On the second occasion Colby achieved his aim, dropping by parachute, landing in the sea, and being picked up by boat. An appropriate Carnival satirical song, entitled  \"Colby\", was composed. The chorus of \"Colby\" is: Jusqu' Colby que l\u00e9 badin\u00e9 nous! Jusqu' Colby que l\u00e9 badin\u00e9 nous! Colby mont\u00e9, Colby descende, Colby tomb\u00e9 dans d' l'eau!
