Satie completed the whole set as a manuscript by April 2, 1888, but after this the 3 parts were published individually: the third in November 1888, the first and the second in 1895. 3eme Gymnop\u00e9die was dedicated to composer Conrad Levad\u00e9 on the first publication in 1888. The three short, atmospheric pieces are written in 3\/4 time, with each sharing a common theme and structure. 1re Gymnop\u00e9die Lent et douloureux (D major \/ D minor) 2e Gymnop\u00e9die Lent et triste (C major) 3e Gymnop\u00e9die Lent et grave (A minor) By the end of 1896, Satie's popularity was waning and financial situation deteriorating. Claude Debussy a friend of Satie's whose popularity was on the rise, helped draw public attention to Satie's work. In February 1897, Debussy orchestrated the third and first Gymnop\u00e9dies. When Debussy published the scores two years later, he reversed the numbering, with Satie's first becoming Debussy's third, and vice versa.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1547716","1549211","985069","774848","979108","1329219","338541","789989"],"submission_ids":["293674","293660"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Classical work","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}

Satie completed the whole set as a manuscript by April 2, 1888, but after this the 3 parts were published individually: the third in November 1888, the first and the second in 1895. 2e Gymnop\u00e9die was dedicated to his brother Conrad Satie on the first publication in 1895 (but on the manuscript from April 1888 it was dedicated to his friend (mon ami) Arthur Dodement though) The three short, atmospheric pieces are written in 3\/4 time, with each sharing a common theme and structure. 1re Gymnop\u00e9die Lent et douloureux (D major \/ D minor) 2e Gymnop\u00e9die Lent et triste (C major) 3e Gymnop\u00e9die Lent et grave (A minor) By the end of 1896, Satie's popularity was waning and financial situation deteriorating. Claude Debussy a friend of Satie's whose popularity was on the rise, helped draw public attention to Satie's work. In February 1897, Debussy orchestrated the third and first Gymnop\u00e9dies. When Debussy published the scores two years later, he reversed the numbering, with Satie's first becoming Debussy's third, and vice versa.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1546634","1305444","1549211","985069","1546670","985131"],"submission_ids":["293673","293659"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Classical work","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}
