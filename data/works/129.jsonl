In the last movement the orchestra is joined by a wordless female chorus. Each movement of the suite is named after a planet of the Solar System and its supposed astrological character. The first movement to be written was Mars in mid-1914, followed by Venus and Jupiter in the latter part of the year, Saturn and Uranus in mid-1915, Neptune later in 1915 and Mercury in early 1916. Holst completed the orchestration during 1917. In an early sketch for the suite Holst listed Mercury as \"no. 1\", which Greene suggests raises the possibility that the composer's first idea was simply to depict the planets in the obvious order, from nearest the sun to the farthest. \"However, opening with the more disturbing character of Mars allows a more dramatic and compelling working out of the musical material\". For the 7 movements see: 01: Mars, the Bringer of War 02: Venus, the Bringer of Peace 03: Mercury, the Winged Messenger 04: Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity 05: Saturn, the Bringer of Old Age 06: Uranus, the Magician 07: Neptune, the Mystic The premiere of The Planets was at the Queen's Hall, London, on September 29, 1918, conducted by Holst's friend Adrian Boult before an invited audience of about 250 people. In 1922 and 1923 all the seven movements were recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Gustav Holst himself. In 1923 and 1924 these recordings were released  individually on seven seperate discs. In 1925 these same recordings were released as an album-set on Columbia set number 29.
