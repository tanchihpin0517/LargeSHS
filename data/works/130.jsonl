While its words concern a wife who does not know how to wash and iron and is sent back home, its true meaning was clear to all. Jean Fouchard, author of Meringues et Danses d\u2019Haiti, calls it the first cry of \u201cYankee go home!\u201d It was repeatedly played by popular and bourgeois bands to express the population\u2019s desire to have their country un-occupied. This song was so well received that it endured and was quickly adopted in night clubs around the country and played over and over again throughout the remaining years of the American occupation. The song is widely known in Haiti and is now generally regarded as a Haitian traditional song.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1577607","1577692","1577679","1576968"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}
