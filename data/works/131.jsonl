Early versions of this ballad were accompanied with varying tunes like \"Spanish Ladies\" and \"Get Along Little Dogies\".

The song tells the tale of Eppie Morrie, a young woman who is forcefully taken from her home by Willie and his companions, who want to make her marry Willie. She refuses, either because she has a suitor or finds Willie unworthy. Willie first tries to force a priest at gunpoint to marry them, but the priest refuses. Eppie is then locked in a room with Willie, who attempts to rape her. After a struggle, Eppie, still a virgin and unmarried, is rescued by armed men led by John Forsyth.
