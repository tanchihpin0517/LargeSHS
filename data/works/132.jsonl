He has taken the white cockade and joined Prince Charlie's armies. She promises to sell her possessions to equip him well. Some versions describe how Prince Charles was displaced. The white cockade was a Jacobite emblem. Bonnie Prince Charlie (Charles Edward Stuart, 1720-1788) was the son of James (III), himself the son of James II, the English king deposed in 1689\/90. This piece is often found as a fiddle tune. It may be that it lost its words because people dared not sing a Jacobite song, but liked the melody. The song was probably first published in 1787 in \"Scots Musical Museum\" and as such often been credited to Robert Burns.

It was inspired by the London dock strike at that time, as well as activities of the Irish Land League, the Paris Commune, the Russian nihilists, and Chicago anarchists. It first appeared in print in the paper Justice, 21 December 1889, under the heading \"A Christmas Carol\", with subheadings, \"The Red Flag\", \"Air \u2013 'The White Cockade'\", and was signed \"J. Connell\". Although Connell had wanted it sung to the tune of a pro-Jacobite Robert Burns anthem, \"The White Cockade\", since 1895 (popularised by British socialist writer Adolphe Smith Headingley in the 1890s) it was sung to the tune of \"Lauriger Horatius\", better known as the German carol \"O Tannenbaum\" (\"O Christmas Tree\"). Connell disapproved of the Tannenbaum tune, which he regarded as \"church music\" and conservative by nature. Despite this the song quickly became an anthem of the international labour movement.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"The White Cockade written by Robert Burns , [Traditional] The Red Flag [poem] written by Jim Connell -\n                            and music from \"The White Cockade\"","adapted_from_id":"311754","performance_ids":["1597611","1597461"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}

Tom wants the horse back soon, but it is slow in returning, for it has taken sick and died. (Now the horse's ghost can be seen haunting the moors at night) The notes by Sabine Baring-Gould in \"Songs and ballads of the West\" (1891) At present the best known and most popular of Devonshire songs. The original Uncle \"Tom Cobleigh \" lived in a house near Yeoford Junction. The names in the chorus all belonged to residents at Sticklepath. The tune and words first came to me (in 1888 sic) from W. F. Collier, Esq., of Woodtown, Horrabridge. Other versions, slightly varying, then poured in. A slight variant has been published by Mr. W. Davies, of Kingsbridge. There is one more verse in the original, which I have been forced to omit from lack of room. I obtained on Dartmoor the same song to a different air, an old dance tune. But \"Widdicombe Fair\" is in fact an adaptation of a much older Nursery Rhyme: \"THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF THE GREY MARE\" (Roud #5418), published in 1810 in Gammer Gurton's Garland.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1598551","1598845","1598501","1599158","1598701","1598523","1598759","1598781","1598768","1598674","1598816","1598825"],"submission_ids":["204513"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"261","managed_by":null}

Using the word shadow in the middle of each stanza, with its meaning changing with each use. First being a literal shadow, the second implying gloom or despair, the third denoting a ghost, the last referencing the \"Valley of the Shadow of Death\". Written at the time of the California gold rush, it tells the tale of a knight who embarks on a quest to find the fabled land of Eldorado, a place of immense wealth and happiness. As he ages and grows weary from the fruitless search, he meets a mysterious shadow who tells him that Eldorado can only be found in the \"Valley of the Shadow\"\u2014a metaphor for death. The poem explores themes of unattainable dreams and the relentless pursuit of an ideal that may only be realized in the afterlife. Ultimately, it reflects on the elusive nature of human desires and the inevitability of death.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1601576"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Poem","added_by":"99660","managed_by":null}

Bill Beasley, owner of the Nashville based record company Republic, and his wife Joan Norris wrote \"Too Much\". The writers were listed on the label of the original Bernard Hardison recording as \"Norris - Weinman\". Weinman was Bernie Weinman, a financial partner with Beasley. The record stiffed, and the song was forgotten until Elvis released it. Later lawsuits indicated that some intriguing machinations had replaced Norris' name in the songwriting credits with that of Lee Rosenberg. Rosenberg was apparently Weinman's secretary, and she was the person who placed the record in the hands of Elvis. According to the lawsuit, Weinman and Rosenberg filed for a copyright as the writers of \"Too Much\" in 1956, having not copyrighted it in 1955 under the actual writers names. Being flush with cash from the success of a number one single, Weinman had the better attorneys and won the lawsuit, so instead of \"Too Much\", Beasley and Norris were left with nothing at all. Incidentally, the Rosenberg share of the publishing money was the part that went to Elvis.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["31527","742955","31528","903136","210535","99846","437752","375016","171659","128332","764753","164041","1194712","1241616","1036311","323833","129012","334639","498166","767283","137690","234054","115396","129953","203566","105470","167626","1135368","1094671","1335923","95269"],"submission_ids":["269508"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"9","managed_by":null}

Early recordings did not carry credits and the first that did, Louie Jordan's version, was credited to Perry Bradford and Bert Mays. Mays and\/or Mayo Williams were often co-credited with Bradford on early recordings. Later, Little Richard claimed credit on his version, which was a top 10 hit in the US and so brought the song renewed popularity, and more recent recordings sometimes credit him.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["125554","125562","125565","279438","125564","125563","618618","3228","95031","522111","174005","125566","389411","79713","519156","360959","378542","935364","801464","272990","758209","396377","3581","3229","509327","199404","509647","127120","393208","368709","13657","155629","445706","88238","1422059","48664","606313","279433","262969","721220","1275385","84917","383890","99841","483394","189055","89500","231702","1143843","1310123","133030","572858","1409678","210059","673506","430039","391038","196354","89962","285483","221379","494998","978655","1331220","367555","588202","700309","500557","568676","322444","773646","1440950","511219","1125689"],"submission_ids":["94819","225140","253690","205458"],"web_cover_ids":["2470"],"type":"Song","added_by":"2","managed_by":null}
