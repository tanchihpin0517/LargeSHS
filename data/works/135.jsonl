The song and accompanying sheet music were massive sellers and the authorship was hotly contested. Others have claimed full and partial credit, including Nat Shilkret who claims to have composed the final music used in the song as well as Massey's brother, Robert, who supposedly learned it while in prison and passed it on to Guy.  It also has much in common with a poem by J. Augustine Wade called \"Meet Me by Moonlight Alone\" that was set to music and published in Philadelphia in 1912. In the end, the song is considered to be an older Southern folk song, with some of the lyrics possibly based on a contemporary English song. There are a number of other folk songs that share the melody.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["41295","1017104","1209454","461517","1212808","1064256","872798","1296550","352541","88244","739100","573255","1600217","184471","1008294","355482","99614","1347644","1334977","1542235","401424","449773","367133","366808","449009","265553","1240349","1053624","41296","204743","955180","217375","263978","1088895","499540","795229","1032670","1397907","1096640","946896","1047580","983688","1079405","140365","1329735","903470","499409","185310","448189","169845","1575900","1329980","1026406","1185193","1035848","1068922","1425688","1202112","1185189","789312","1198014","972717","1306731","1064263","1091462","779310","260331","290913","974064","1591134","1064245","1081637","1386254","1507065","305147","1412396","145436","229259","1026455","249722","1031142","1242597","1326299","395674","1103217","1496618","902906","1087089","1097202","847544","1087398","1506437","975137","1378123","1253212","1121777"],"submission_ids":["210645","91869","264117","225419","270316","259101","254594","176134"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"2","managed_by":null}

More than half of its melody was in Tampa Red's instrumental composition You Got To Reap What You Sow from the previous year. NOTE: There is another I'm Sitting on Top of the World song by Henderson\/Young\/Lewis that is a more big band era-type song that starts off \"I'm sitting on top of the world, I'm rolling along\". Many of the Vinson songs are mistakenly credited to Henderson\/Young\/Lewis.

Lyrics first appeared (without music) in \"Select Hymns for Christian Worship and General Gospel Service\" (1911) as \"Arr. B. E. W.\" (Barney Elliott Warren, one of the hymnal's editors). The version of the song found in most modern hymnals first appeared in \"Starlit Crown\", 1937, Stamps-Baxter Music Co. \"[as sung by] The Burnette Sisters.\" From 1938 onward, \"Farther Along\" is usually attributed to William B. Stevens (words and music), with the music arranged by J. R. Baxter, Jr. It is likely, however, that the song as we know it is the result of different sources and roots, a sort of \"unintentional collaborative effort\", as it often happens with traditional and religious songs. In fact, at least three other men are sometimes cited as being the original authors: Rev. W. A. Fletcher from Oklahoma, W. P. Jay, a preacher for the Church of the Nazarene born in Arkansas, and a not better identified W. E. Lindsay.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["423336","423333","386220","510678","954460","952325","186130","373749","423188","138592","433919","548414","1472211","342777","138593","833606","1107995","106641","214181","773725","1263156","365513","510201","1045233","264100","1101250","260062","510199","69555","935202","901861","1258445","185200","186229","634297","106916","1061764","1359535","408912","889872","423337","566989","207010","890034","309551","408925","989675","42029","830819","1075312","1105116","975657","1034630","592570","583173","1085315","399972","839091","400821","358195","48746","1033497","510540","85704","953208","492055","103775","508708","497207","157647","325813","427903","960086","1107807","972424","48750","661146","476730","514408","92438","1106036","250189","961155","1071488","925120","1556791","923699","527651","1027097","68973","1571853","930748","1033491","424389","1299728","1128132","977822","1020728","527652","1045966","796716","1001493","960991","527650","787600","1243454","1352797","759594","220944","930905","1443006","1240763","716676","1078435","1107876","1463242","970698","1113554","941446","909265","975175","931595","1048400"],"submission_ids":["193461"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"2","managed_by":null}

The camp meeting inspired him to publish a collection of new and admired hymns, that he had heard there and at other camp meetings. One month after the Boiling Spring camp meeting he published a new hymnbook in Richmond, Virginia titled: A General Selection of the Newest and Most Admired Hymns and Spiritual Songs Now in Use. Among the songs in Mead's 1807 hymnal was Hymn 50, better known as the \"Say Brothers\" or \"Oh Brothers\" hymn. I feel the work reviving (3x) Reviving in my soul. I\u2032m on my way to Zion (3x) The new Jerusalem We'll shout and give Him glory (3x) For glory is His own Oh Christians will you meet me (3x) On Canaan's happy shore There we'll shout and give Him glory (3x) For glory is His own Oh Brothers will you meet me (3x) On Canaan's happy shore By the grace of God I'll meet you (3x) On Canaan's happy shore There we'll shout and give Him glory (3x) For glory is His own Oh Sisters will you meet me (3x) On Canaan's happy shore By the grace of God I'll meet you (3x) On Canaan's happy shore There we'll shout and give Him glory (3x) For glory is His own etc This developed into the familiar Glory, Glory, Hallelujah chorus by the 1850's. The tune and variants of these words spread across both the southern and northern United States. In 1858 words and the tune were published in \"The Union Harp and Revival Chorister\", selected and arranged by Charles Dunbar, and published in Cincinnati. The book contains the words and music of a song \"My Brother Will You Meet Me\", with the music and the words of the \"Glory Hallelujah\" chorus; and the opening line \"Say my brother will you meet me\". Say my brother will you meet me (3x) On Canaan\u2019s happy shore? Yes by the grace of God I\u2019ll meet you (3x) On Canaan\u2019s happy shore. Jesus lives and reigns forever (3x) Forever, ever more Glory, glory, hallelujah ! (3x) Praise God forever more Around 1885 William Steffe claimed he wrote this song in about 1856, with the \" Say Bummers, Will You Meet us \" words. In a few letters to Richard J. Hinton, one of John Brown's biographers,  Steffe states he originally wrote the song for the Goodwill Fire Company of Philadelphia, PA, whose members were known as \"Bummers\". On December 11th, 1885, Steffe wrote: \"...though I never claimed any notoriety in music I want to prove by the best evidence the origin of the music of the popular song. Those who prompted me to write it are all 'gathered to their fathers' most of those who sang \"Say Brothers will you meet us\" -- are 'beyond the river'....\" But, given the above facts, it appears that Steffe simply adapted the traditional camp meeting song and wrote a few new words.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1074448","524668","1412855","1401658","1110989","314792","234887","1490215","449230","149222","1384379","1099355","1443958","942162","212142","1170130","1375461","1099422","952668","309981","1261202","1011847","138304","953358","1154162","658211","1201189","1487059","115488","1001956","401132","1082752","522087","222710","219814","1200747","529244","627836","1007730","1105078","802069","621159","172825","804638","231778","689819","1303381","513943","1469478","523628","1353913","1194348","1241801","267468","357649","1224010","1496612","1229001","589112","1108522","1193969","1196262","1217498","1103725","1082589","1257110","1360619","1124989","473323","532309","1478671","455614","176336","313972","1139538","1125289","1432901","1156536","1055358","650458","1077712","1152643","1068058","932933","1378002","529709","830440","1238038","1153088","639688","1597042","346910","258422","1346439","483780","439696","1405621","313184","170733","1008306","940972","632128","230747","1190867","669151","1267413","532113","1092055","659762","632252","1440774","898674","1356218","503446","461259","1267679","746209","899572","451190","1025166","707917","1104991","1194590","1065886","474619","636631","579813","1247575","261774","827970","571010","209321","1243362","1236729","1065771","588967","1210217","760306","1007638","575659","1336527","667646","1139209","1341397","1354570","1301665"],"submission_ids":["235838","248668","256704","257696","190723","176646","283906"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3","managed_by":"261"}

Within a year this new hymn was being sung by civilians in the North, Union troops on the march, and even prisoners of war held in Confederate jails. As a result of their volunteer work with the Sanitary Commission, in November of 1861 Samuel and Julia Howe were invited to Washington by President Lincoln. The Howes visited a Union Army camp in Virginia across the Potomac. There, they heard the men singing the song which had been sung by both North and South, one in admiration of John Brown, one in celebration of his death: \"John Brown's body lies a'mouldering in his grave.\" A clergyman in the party, James Freeman Clarke, who knew of Julia's published poems, urged her to write a new song for the war effort to replace \" John Brown's Body \". She described the events later: \"I replied that I had often wished to do so.... In spite of the excitement of the day I went to bed and slept as usual, but awoke the next morning in the gray of the early dawn, and to my astonishment found that the wished-for lines were arranging themselves in my brain. I lay quite still until the last verse had completed itself in my thoughts, then hastily arose, saying to myself, I shall lose this if I don't write it down immediately. I searched for an old sheet of paper and an old stub of a pen which I had had the night before, and began to scrawl the lines almost without looking, as I learned to do by often scratching down verses in the darkened room when my little children were sleeping. Having completed this, I lay down again and fell asleep, but not before feeling that something of importance had happened to me.\" The result was a poem, published first in February 1862 in the Atlantic Monthly, and called \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\". In the late 1800s, during the song's height of popularity, a number of other authors claimed to have played a part in the origin of the song. Some sources list William Steffe , Thomas Brigham Bishop, Frank E. Jerome, and others as the tune's composer. Given the tune's use in the camp meeting circuits in the late 1700s and early 1800s and the first known publication dates of 1806\u20131808, long before most of these claimants were born, it is apparent that none of these authors composed the tune that was the basis of \" Say Brothers, Will You Meet Us? \", \" John Brown's Body \" and \" Battle Hymn of the Republic \".","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Say Brothers, Will You Meet Us? written by [Traditional]","adapted_from_id":"43760","performance_ids":["1362561","43762","43763","1069370","1203430","1028308","575260","1009341","1062252","517962","149879","215570","949088","346891","588079","1035671","184633","725062","1336182","1315949","327115","1346344","1219404","1109356","725209","1054596","931686","538174","1383971","1344895","1258449","69876","186133","106668","418997","289256","505232","1334971","109588","1060406","1468580","52120","679330","1298275","1231883","1072034","869922","1500766","813109","154806","46304","897661","1352716","1169216","850391","1540604","1540635","1070229","532341","169468","532467","1401680","853346","281799","1079369","225651","1016517","1043142","1401804","1050840","453835","77351","1165885","1074448","396332","1161825","526748","474594","1579756","363191","1282789","1219403","127148","669438","1057207","337266","1192049","1506960","508157","1007114","985334","565868","1312474","204080","1104007","1290486","1151589","517707","1378221","1166218","1322767","1362562","280563","1595185","1275699","213180","557775","1070197","556967","1447064","346833","220293","463482","234540","346867","1109462","460141","411818","565701","984867","1200317","1035638","1064748","1092761","1559663","1517616"],"submission_ids":["68474","84829","188787"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"3","managed_by":"52961"}

While some sources (without much evidence) date the carol to the 16th century or even earlier, the earliest known text is in a handwritten volume of recusant verse and prose associated with Jesuit families in Warwickshire that was assembled in the 1650s. The words are recognisably those of the carol, although the first line is \"Sit you merry Gentlemen\". By the early 1700s, the carol was beginning to be printed in broadsides (with \"God rest you merry Gentlemen\" as the first line) and by the turn of the century into the 1800s, the carol had become very popular and well-known. Charles Dickens mentioned it in his novella \"A Christmas Carol\" (1843).

A pair of names -- Stanley J. Lewis and Eleanor Broadwater -- were added to Hawkins's on the publishing sheet without his knowledge, effectively splitting the authorship of the song into thirds. Neither had anything to do with the song's creation, Hawkins points out: Lewis was a record-store owner in Shreveport who carried Chess imprints; Broadwater was the wife of a popular Nashville deejay, Gene Nobles, to whom Chess owed favors.\"","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1466415","4489","1242758","108432","331469","246441","709050","4490","39201","420831","420181","460201","62980","897841","519063","81788","570809","68305","491537","365835","893532","965018","439793","9294","880708","1474335","21056","84976","1160581","420914","65733","1459183","377588","381019","444976","86225","363034","364601","372920","12289","1206374","1378711","18310","412074","393624","1069975","511234","265173","761779","370921","116833","1296426","76700","1447346","1261044","486312","1571838","219335","1264564","869654","366924","1134768","1317181","1276099","1243878","1464506","1578255","617794","403369","1047556","1580923","63797","163846","884812","883664","1145097","188504","445737","716615","527466","1120956","1113157","490570","1142808","1548039","1118504","1263400"],"submission_ids":["69738","126133","126143","76377","126141","76379","76378","126142","76381","126140","76383","126138","126091","104226","216301","287092","126115","126116","126130","164831","186554","126079","288818","126134","76384","126117","126148","126132","76382","126131","126103","126104","126114","274051","126137","230789"],"web_cover_ids":["15258","15258","15247","15247","15257","15257","15264","15264","15269","15269","15270","15270","15271","15271"],"type":"Song","added_by":"2","managed_by":null}
