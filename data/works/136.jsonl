There are at least four theories about it: 1) Paul Rice wrote it in 1937, inspired by a letter from a fan, and sold his rights to Jimmie Davis and Charles Mitchell in 1940. Some time later, Mitchell sold his share to Davis. This story is the most trustworthy. 2) Jimmie Davis wrote it in the early twenties. This version is unprovable. 3) An unknown lady singer from South Carolina wrote the song and offered it to the Pine Ridge Boys. Another unconfirmed story, but at least it would explain why they were the first to record it. 4) According to Prof. Toru Mitsui (Kanazawa University), the song was written in 1933 by Oliver Hood. Although the source is very authoritative, also this theory cannot be proven for certain. When it was copyrighted in 1940 it was attributed to Jimmie Davis and Charles Mitchell . Currently, only Davis is registered as the composer and author of the song.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["45675","45676","954145","45677","379622","1027797","45680","45678","45679","393329","1389528","1306356","721966","443731","739109","309364","387356","1462619","1389519","793752","483469","290491","72803","68722","57899","817737","277729","1443921","259046","1268686","140200","265989","57894","531117","398366","894388","57895","1103226","1297549","714948","121836","768424","1000349","1308262","843739","600120","409305","667512","115833","1088913","758246","469666","858452","1503340","57898","45806","834510","88845","1397501","533816","57896","538773","515095","211437","187091","391144","67620","1461492","57897","834436","881639","385882","254357","390940","326790","88844","1461933","930903","154486","946939","279017","459928","259083","997881","961725","45970","138965","1485684","402499","289274","671375","546853","463955","362096","244282","367567","957426","736435","935370","895176","1245981","1593833","961254","480410","342040","1298323","45681","414285","401603","300995","102252","984545","346942","618882","241530","956894","915172","923972","486102","580315","1244926","1137657","1381376","1058604","656501","1116262","133230","319451","452333","1321101","1288895","420243","611503","912223","1354614","603880","1237428","616390","109311","345765","290276","1197533","505572","844214","930781","57893","964468","400742","46188","594283","1056856","405373","775079","225092","881406","826289","1199443","158817","187263","751917","427215","349517","1338555","871014","104001","719508","1428882","489546","54992","367957","87170","45682","855012","280622","526987","916439","349639","177013","45683","1292736","1197685","949888","1443084","85463","1294494","276334","267235","1125204","141926","1029231","358122","426072","866478","514598","332129","91966","972461","557616","807365","289395","872713","428535","1242658","246171","48844","197733","337611","1237117","522930","729781","917432","320853","538545","1510854","1012941","451795","451973","1243924","133021","862124","1047548","434900","1383157","1453989","129442","1237817","135920","1376688","1154467","1324386","599537","864172","730323","916072","743437","1485326","1080574","1584626","916484","374726","536673","232290","347334","332398","324714","277994","1500131","1044637","359655","511305","1098864","352461","347467","1600665","401492","1526144","936486","866543","503781","513971","584845","614679","782033","784018","931805","1593102","1252786","1516608","796801","1273071","867306","888106","1562692","1394370","904304","1305036","1220264","1253141","1185224","1586850","1157610","1241044","1599610","1360495","1301076","1562829","1349935","1339376","1441289","1565521","1428226","1433539","1497599","1605705","918290","138746","194479","1381723","879211","227762","1372037","305143","1452362","1214668","1215474","445038","1308072","1158948","287997","988085","319947","595218","170165","917141","688788","1584014","1022736","1535532","1249182","147616","1118033","1411133","131573","888135","671296","891205","442068","952764","1002636","1026428","819032","241573","1259267","1291964","210976","417212","563156","155836","1048964","433394","1451430","1038016","646968","297626","644829","1189421","1328186","416181","632719","1241558","511901","427846","1249539","1228996","1533550","549741","796078","586715","1320955","1254497","1017298","175919","1057058","1201233","150069","471285","568598","1239754","1114155","225606","251780","604036","670364","272829","1167147","359947","1338504","1103841","189794","249092","665279","272016","1172514","331086","1366139","100483","1252006","150397","284848","1172136","978977","927166","1169992","1011517","1211520","733633","479143","934076","1260075","1295349","1074047","615166","878444","797458","350598","1195328","940278","627563","1213827","1233714","1194400","1305876","1263551","1096974","331101","286952","491419","647231","545816","920571","341937","504042","919178","1278858","552361","1177790","397064","961745","1086412","1062178","598112","839506","1126929","539663","572515","611686","847104","739850","962352","1273863","1220942","1312347","1447243","1514299","1512428"],"submission_ids":["222816","203741","101030","222385","284052","203088","244815","190379","165171","155695","192256","229584","225158","225805","160398","307056","119471","159482","187908","249776","177226","180870","113276","183670","202897","227800","269019","203372","177933","225683","169028","117108","284022","291494","272518","180874","188112"],"web_cover_ids":["20918","20918","14295","20915","20915","20917","20917","997","997","20919","20919","20916","20916"],"type":"Song","added_by":"19","managed_by":"2"}

Only the bass line and six bars of melody had survived. Giazotto never produced the fragment and no record of its presence has been found in the collection of the Saxon State Library. At one point, Giazotto himself claimed full credit for the work. Since his death in 1998, \"Albinoni's Adagio\" is commonly attributed solely to Giazotto.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["701539","1366351","1435374","701493","1605227","1313627","701536","629110","810884","701534","215517","480855","1361645","938548","774840","120853","1021538","1409263","904956","236878","117192","453424","126823","295091","117529","891577","781143","1289056","1467818"],"submission_ids":["143218","249376","145866","247941","140880","289048","250494","169675","31866"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"5","managed_by":"2"}

She took the idea to Leon Russell, who was a guitarist and keyboardist with Delaney and Bramlett and Friends at the time. Russell brought the raw material to Bonnie Bramlett, and together they began shaping it into a song. Coolidge sat and sang harmony as they wrote the song, but never asked for a writing credit. Several artists, including Cher, Coolidge herself and Bette Midler, all performed the song, but it was the Carpenters version that made the song a hit.

This version is also known as \"Mueller\", after a mysterious composer called Carl Mueller. To date, nothing has been found about his identity and his role in the composition. Nevertheless, there are several documents (especially from the 1920's and 1930's) that mention the song as credited to Martin Luther (lyrics) and Carl Mueller (music). It is likely that the false attribution to a \"German\" composer should serve as a sort of proof that the song came from Germany, where the Lutheranism was born. Note that in the UK the lyrics are usually set to the tune \"Cradle Song\", written in 1895 by William J. Kirkpatrick.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"Cradle Song written by Charles H.
