A compromise was sought but wasn't found, so the matter ended up in court where notably Gary Jackson [US] and Carl Smith [US2] claimed they found the music sheet \"in a wastepaper basket at Chess.\" Eventually, the court ruled in favor of Miner\/Davis, and the song credits got split unevenly between Davis & Miner (80%) and Jackson & Smith (20%).
