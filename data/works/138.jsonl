Today, most copies of the film delete the \"Sweet Marijuana\" number. This was the first film in which Kitty Carlisle appeared as an actress.  She says that at the time the \"Sweet Marijuana\" number was shot, she didn't know what marijuana was and believed it to be a type of Mexican instrument.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["157400","5323","157405","157433","157434","1318216","157408","157448","1318226","5324","581331","790845","1318184","1364940","157452","430060","1153885","1318237","157479","1502188","157450","157449","157483","1364941","1161977","1133216","1235072","1173064","157438","1318247","1125124","535967","994169","1385665","764852","1318287","764853","764872","1178756","764851","157416","1143944","1138188","538443","1176243","157478","457349","1302923","1318288"],"submission_ids":["255837","175539","187118","215758","178204"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"2","managed_by":null}

It tells the tragic tale of a young girl (usually from London City\/Town), who commits suicide after being jilted by her lover (a butcher's boy usually named Willie) who left her for another of higher stature. Her father finds her dead body, along with a note dictating her final wishes. There is an American variant of the story called \"Railroad Boy\" that replaces the butcher's boy with a railroad boy but tells the same tragic story. Jean Ritchie recorded the song as \"Go Dig My Grave\" (using the railroad boy).  Ritchie registered her version but it's essentially the same song (she just sings the verses in a different order).

First recorded as \"There's More Pretty Gals Than One\" by Leonard Rutherford & John D. Rutherford on July 28, 1927, but the side was rejected by Gennett.  They re-recorded it on April 11, 1929, as \"There's More Pretty Girls Than One\", and it was issued on Challenge 423 under one of their budget label pseudonyms \"Crocker and Cannon\".  Arthur Smith and the Delmore Brothers recorded it in 1936, as The Arthur Smith Trio, and the work was registered by the Delmore Brothers, but it's clearly improbable that they wrote it. Original 1929 lyrics - Up and down that lonesome road, Hang down your head and cry, Thinking about those pretty girls, And I wish I'll never die. CHORUS: There's more pretty girls than one, There's more pretty girls than one; Everywhere I ramble around, There's more pretty girls than one. (fiddle) There's things that's never been taught Pretty shoes that's never been bought Everywhere I ramble around, There's more pretty girls than one. CHORUS (fiddle) My mama told me one day, She gave me good advice, She told me to quit my ramblin' 'round, And marry me a lovin' wife.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["959659","211074","959661","1110870","350362","359875","56963","56964","198095","1053963","959664","930084","490731","1038238","1053937","211075","866677","950267","277789","1018719","1082376","643091","359878","516334","371462","958868","1034767","1564905","365426","981394","1042410","982440","1180616","1204604","1087529","838100","1029080","369856","1068433","1097054","1102209","1030739","1097856"],"submission_ids":["161046"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"9","managed_by":null}
