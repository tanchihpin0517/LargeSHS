Musically, it is inspired by the Scottish air Robaidh Dona Gorach while its lyrics are freely adaptated from the civil war song The Rebel Soldier . In both cases, the resemblances are too hazy to call it a \u201ccover\u201d. Moreover, the song is vaguely related to The Cuckoo . Furthermore, this song has dozens of titles, depending on its \u201cfunction\u201d: for instance, the instrumental, dance version was mostly performed under the name of \u201cDrunken Hiccups\u201d, \u201cJack of Diamonds\u201d had to do with gambling (and nothing to do with the Blind Lemon Jefferson blues song with the same name), \u201cRye Whiskey\u201d was the favorite title among moonshiners and so on.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["979301","1021792","61289","61240","61239","688654","1021533","1096579","1047444","260393","599627","323887","409933","309361","1011541","981239","401401","1033068","1053273","1185198","1053891","835731","1096393","1053906","1032746","1032564","359928","979303","445463","337586","394358","1063133","930220","1426274","1054629","371378","1267081","936162","787920","612227","1097417","359881","1373061","411915","1046145","1090123","1503130","61241","1037253","937534","1571855","1093247","378736","1014910","1078333","938124","1097490","1037533","1354540","1038413","351232","1027114","395736","340211","1086673","979285","497047","961442","1056213","1053793","373317","1077534","1076669","1555851","1065525","1092919","930910","1097049","620757","1094315","1080233","1027766","863140","1031601","1023142","1311842","1592114","1176340","1032568","367305","1102172","1022903","933202","1018448","937843","1026272","1449303","1091802","1093188","1093458","1042858","953999","1091803","1045636","1090917","1094127","1027108","1077024","1057919","979297","1025655","1096985","1046144","1097968","980153","1057555"],"submission_ids":["272612"],"web_cover_ids":["15693","15693"],"type":"Song","added_by":"19","managed_by":"99660"}

This is a tale of an Irish highwayman who robs an English military or government official but is later betrayed by his wife or sweetheart. The song's exact origins are unknown but it is thought to have originated in the 17th Century.  Several similarities with another folksong suggest it might have once been specific to the crimes of Patrick Flemming, an Irish highwayman circa 1650, who maimed and killed many travellers before being executed. He was caught because his weapon had been intentionally dampened so it would malfunction. Different versions of the song are set in various places throughout Ireland and the names of characters also change; the official can be a Captain Farrell or a Colonel Pepper and the highwayman\u2019s companion Molly or Jenny.  The details of the betrayal can also differ, such as handing him over to the authorities, hiding his weapon or switching his ammunition. In some cases, he ends up in prison; in other cases, he escapes with his brother and they both hide in the mountains. Despite its violent content, the song is delivered as a light-hearted celebration of debauchery and is usually a communal sing-along. At some point in the colonial period, the song was carried to the United States where it was popular for its irreverent attitude toward British officials.  Some American versions deal with American characters in American settings such as the Ozarks or Appalachians. The 1967 release by the Dubliners brought the song to a wide audience and the 1972 arrangement by Thin Lizzy, with Eric Bell's distinct guitar line mimicking Uilleann pipes, has been very influential.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["634340","769214","293048","310737","1040098","776213","293034","499645","293029","293028","960576","634277","390062","310750","293030","181647","293031","1030177","44784","283301","691405","6415","1203861","1575220","704570","358126","1484008","310735","710575","501082","1016423","1302010","44588","275797","1557826","363636","850871","285161","1308062","1023413","131558","131333","310754","6416","310767","6952","412611","843655","1185455","755070","395294","35126","102830","182407","304443","700795","1300799","1147320","926892","412598","291892","991959","52670","1099209","193175","631519","114749","1549945","602937","185457","96345","498695","1248890","147677","1164378","1140261","1526056","209319","494896","1205024","1243545","1205196","1132678","373908","1325007","1058072","1179207","836429","388013","1375655","1286209","1081449","1343323","597911","852132","903905","1404073","1425669","1524952","1514089","192398","171833","846857","1116014","837548","968892","1125281","1043171"],"submission_ids":["225461","225477","259338","194802","177724","257618","208562","247289","259667","259488","257000","195199","259566","180084","159178","282333","238782"],"web_cover_ids":["21432","21432","17321","17321","4059"],"type":"Song","added_by":"2","managed_by":null}

The song most always opens with some variation of \"There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun...\"  Throughout the years it's been arranged by multiple artists, and since it's in the public domain has been registered by scores of performers as their own work, but so many of the versions have floating lyrics and musical components it wouldn't be well-served to selectively credit adaptations of the same name. The song is most famously known by The Animals' 1964 recording, which is now often seen as the standard.","licensing":"Request a synchronization

The earliest recording appears to have been by Peg Leg Howell in 1928 as \"Rock and Gravel Blues\".  All of the performances share the common refrain \"It takes rocks and gravel, baby to make a solid road\" to start the song, but from there can have widely floating lyrics.  Howell's release didn't have songwriting credits but most every version thereafter was registered by the respective performer as the original wasn't copyrighted.  Instead of creating umpteen adaptations, SHS is treating them all as arrangements. NOTE: There is another song called Rocks and Gravel that is likely derived from the same traditional African-American work song.  It is performed as a spiritual with much different pace and very different lyrics.  Those versions seem to always start with the refrain \"Well it's early in the mornin', the mornin', Well, when I rise...\".  It's likely that one of the two \"Rocks and Gravel\" Works was the precursor of the other so they should be formally linked, but not certain which one came first.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["1032132","1032130","219696","1459588","1088200","64175","1582805","1584796","64176"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"9","managed_by":null}
