Other versions of the song have evolved, including \"The Pale Amaranthus\" (collected in Kentucky and North Carolina, reported in 1911), \"Raven Black Hair\" and \"The Pale Wildwood Flower\" (collected 1915\u20131919), and \"The Frail Wildwood Flower\". A.P. Carter registered \"Wildwood Flower\" as his own after The Carter Family's 1928 recording (copyrighted October 20, 1935), but lyrics are almost identical to \"I'll Twine 'Mid the Ringlets\".  He did convert it from a parlor song to a folk rendition and though Carter arguably doesn't warrant it, assigning adaptation status to Carter so there is a separate grouping for \"Wildwood Flower\". The Carter Family lyrics - I will twine, I will mingle my raven black hair With the roses so red and the lilies so fair And the myrtle so bright with it's emerald hue The pale emanita and the hyssop so blue I will dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway I woke from my dreaming, my idol was clay All portions of loving had all flown away But he taught me to love him and promised to love And to cherish me over all others above My poor heart is wondering no misery can tell He left with no warning, no word of farewell Well you told me you love me and called me your flower That was blooming to cheer you through life's dreary hour I live to see him regret life's dark hour He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"I'll Twine 'Mid the Ringlets written by Joseph Webster , J.

Apparently, it was originally written (or at least conceived) by Lee \"Scratch\" Perry and then reworked by Bob Marley. In fact, \"Small Axe\" and its credits are part of a much bigger feud involving Lee Perry, The Wailers and Island records. Perry sold the master recordings of the songs he produced for The Wailers to UK label Trojan Records , reportedly without the artists\u2019 permission. Years later, the band (possibly under Chris Blackwell's input) decided to re-record those songs and include them in their Island releases, an act that Perry saw as an attempt to overshadow his contribution to The Wailers\u2019 sound and success. As a result, the song is credited to Lee Perry or Perry & Marley on Trojan- and Upsetter -issued releases, while Island-issued releases only credit Bob Marley. Ironically, the song\u2019s lyrics contain a thinly-veiled attack on the Jamaican record industry, at the time dominated by three major forces, \u201cthe big three\u201d [tree] that were going to be cut down by the \u201csmall acts\u201d [axe].","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["65933","370510","92623","65934","583723","1415269","772571","1136959","1027784","1393079"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"19","managed_by":null}

'Avalon' was added during performances at The Winter Garden in New York City in 1920. The song later appeared in the musical \"Bombo\" (1922). The opening melody of the tune is actually a lift from Giacomo Puccini\u2019s aria \u201cE lucevan le stelle,\u201d from the opera Tosca. Rose merely changed the melody from minor to major and added some melody bits of his own. But it was an obvious enough lift that Puccini\u2019s publishers, 'Casa Ricordi', sued the composers and the publisher in 1921 and were awarded $25,000 in punitive damages and all future royalties.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"E lucevan le stelle written by Giacomo Puccini , Giuseppe Giacosa , Luigi Illica","adapted_from_id":"6207","performance_ids":["67735","885625","1364919","1440344","1477706","170036","153734","338179","274340","190306","414870","953178","158847","1261204","871068","664743","483733","149621","1274106","901653","1190561","593216","1217786","1292514","1301159","860718","730166","1273995","1180039","149001","1222861","1165648","1306699","1265437","228365","131985","70895","769338","1095626","1272267","1174283","466765","638243","611098","582228","495087","69872","796154","1080734","1231742","1249719","214483","1155688","1396296","1454927","540418","556672","391818","183813","756035","1144877","414665","324617","1140356","1227621","313020","934032","703557","1248039","1356450","1258994","1239343","1551572","1167928","891098","1357505","1409587","1460250","1409423","1355352","954563","67737","1324360","1477529","1207057","1289919","1325276","1437496","1323893","1460725","1008125","1250446","1469595","1450557","1581952","1160848","1228522","1335212","1252480","1403093","1518440","1334649","1418023","1413391","1114216","1146085","1222416","1194296","1201477","1082834","1153586","1244877","1385907","1165578","1135107","1491070","1343801","1147312","1166838","1339778","1322423","1374409","1180029","1472952","1250021","1198252","1078379","1229388","1093915","1197139","1079884","1106322","1192160","1091422","1158971","1317543","1282037","1428129","1146447","1157917","1084838","1414413","1233627","1231125","1313908","1398159","1219471","1233923","1578072","1268256","1105031","1367893","1092114","1254750","1551298","1420184","1166144","1105246","1081094","1077815","1088609","1166652","1449948","1077706"],"submission_ids":["96583","280585","159943","280232","172528","167636","240808","266128"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"23","managed_by":"2"}
