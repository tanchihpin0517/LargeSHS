Years later, Dall'Aglio decided to tell his version of the story after he heard Gianco saying: \"Pugni chiusi is the best song I've written\". Ironically, the authors (whether real or fake) were accused of plagiarism already upon the release of the song: according to many music critics and experts, Pugni chiusi sounded \"too similar\" to When a Man Loves a Woman , although Dall'Oglio claimed that his main source of inspiration had been Georgia on My Mind .","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["70503","96871","252171","70504","76582","110405","1558328","349427"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":["10802"],"type":"Song","added_by":"7","managed_by":"62883"}

Cecil Sharp collected 18 versions of this ballad between 1916 and 1918 and published in his book \"English Folk-Songs from the Southern Appalachians\".  It is number 451 in the Roud Folk Song Index. The song is also known as \"Sparrow\", \"Tiny Sparrow\" and \"Little Sparrow\". Roscoe Holcomb deleted the opening two verses and recorded it in 1965 as \"Willow Tree\", which has led to subsequent cover performances. Lyrics start off - \"Come all ye fair and tender ladies, Take warning how you court your men...\", later in song lyrics are \"I wish I was a little sparrow and I had wings to fly so high...\" Not to be confused with Dolly Parton's Little Sparrow that starts off \"Little sparrow, little sparrow, precious fragile little thing...\"","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["423170","178296","948015","269982","1088667","375354","292791","400847","292939","978282","103108","948003","437558","401340","967770","1095533","1056041","1095366","1018036","326853","1088356","567323","388249","256409","977629","178297","145846","567325","187094","1050154","102216","400722","977035","348191","590199","366698","360799","1041671","1048925","1223560","1056066","403792","1036901","1016641","1461799","1062960","400024","252091","1079305","1287899","319611","265851","252083","958873","1090983","152872","340986","984108","1084410","917978","178298","612538","249139","963140","869970","1509081","1604629","1038421","1094236","290646","574119","1091440","1092545","119258","1286986","600818","185313","1060401","1054929","311783","1165803","209302","1039934","838091","1562304","1287548","1204573","586843","977038","1067824","356231","270346","1468076","220707","1085431","1007590","279232","511346","1088009","1085083","1491979","567322","973828","1360984","1070371","1281998","1467123","1078463","206643","205655","1025689","1122889","1530327","1336150","1355826"],"submission_ids":["170008","144697"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"9","managed_by":null}
