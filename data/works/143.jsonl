However, in 1987 they convinced Orbison to record a demo at Kelly's house with Kelly on guitar or piano. Unfortunately, as Orbison didn't have any record contract at the time, Kelly and Steinberg didn't know what to do with the takes remained unused. Later, the demo sung by Tom Kelly was played for Lauper who then recorded it in 1988. Much later after Orbison's death, his demo was engineered by Jeff Lynne into a finished version.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["7457","7459","135857","7464","7461","7458","65533","705969","1022795","135991","135980","135996","73322","135862","135929","1162966","1139397","212621","1273009","268772","1084766","1171271","1101444","420626","1420501","489768","779630","1124694","1483866","497681","1142730","1228550","1590179"],"submission_ids":["93274","249782","243074"],"web_cover_ids":["23068","23068"],"type":"Song","added_by":"5","managed_by":"25"}

None of them are likely to be the actual writers though. On September 2nd 1928, Joe Bishop joined Al Katz's band and ecouraged Katz to add St. James Infirmary to his repertoire, a song he had learned from his father. Katz was reluctant, but that changed when a few days later William Brookins also joined the band and made the same request. Apparently Brookins had learned the song around 1926 from a piano player, Jack Dalton, in his hometown Dallas. Eventually Brookins sang St. James Infirmary with the Al Katz Orchestra at Detroit's Graystone Ballroom in December 1928, and that's where Don Redman heard it, as his band the McKinney's Cotton Pickers were the resident dance band. Both Bishop and Brookins claim they taught the song to Don Redman on December 5th, 1928. Redman had heard the song before but liked Katz' arrangement, and a week later Louis Armstrong recorded the song in that arrangement. That's how the song briefly got credited to Redman, but this was corrected in subsequent releases.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"The Unfortunate Lad written by [Traditional] -\n                            Substantial part of the lyrics","adapted_from_id":"271902","performance_ids":["7643","424695","390271","689211","67831","1587688","941118","357598","67835","1355071","1353016","67834","67832","849945","1129199","67833","1353003","273781","1275631","1353018","227657","1084308","376733","246640","1137353","281806","101492","1170835","133060","606832","1371485","1586130","917261","1114457","158525","104612","245597","248430","1460727","1455408","215350","103591","1114090","1461653","93000","139292","72559","389860","1059855","876128","186952","101346","86303","1214308","1356440","227159","224894","361482","838802","363678","41923","795373","24995","288164","239438","1459462","21543","336283","445306","24998","453411","1381204","422694","1433732","426487","1280272","24997","1292618","874789","22246","24994","254730","186071","359296","12517","44175","24996","12526","202745","530454","535816","239164","1130053","535741","86762","434478","365796","981772","494266","12531","1217427","1193928","1409830","1051107","383808","212316","246066","267518","167791","1202408","1107411","1265271","602552","1150766","91166","1224143","1290848","1170200","860418","243265","1530014","1494795","1147310","1214746","1159258","1359107","109392","531883","400682","36286","234919","244189","149190","149002","465839","1239423","1464189","909191","1172833","1010729","1192141","1138322","155445","1092086","1189834","1510312","403822","1361985","1257097","1233336","275317","191542","1233387","398921","370026","1182556","349758","967687","1376773","672304","1282845","235406","1413415","1109157","496245","608794","363962","1165926","1093935","1191946","1233504","999923","117242","1241264","1454516","474780","1145244","1593765","526756","615294","1174395","235178","1356412","621636","1503478","150408","1158498","1197158","155307","1538101","7646","541714","1456514","1456860","169130","259873","616590","129362","576388","1443856","797110","712355","501434","1251012","1251160","101540","488481","76708","1147828","1535707","463420","478115","954625","30983","14434","285347","766203","1196388","1204374","124370","1297141","24979","102237","1125219","1594957","1079200","857060","1288248","1105206","1477050","38957","135103","1256586","1156073","1453967","63077","1014592","113427","1224382","169335","736867","194286","1260131","1200476","988212","367206","1296267","425790","1394075","1047042","908844","791079","557599","85718","97531","1182829","269200","223708","1210394","103183","91932","715838","744958","886445","1509255","563291","146524","328543","789836","157066","1010518","1182901","513403","753621","400249","247100","1277555","489138","1570308","574928","1001226","230758","1002386","1181385","1064892","1312079","1172073","1140269","1227624","1148934","295397","1210009","1557509","922120","353494","348249","1167897","1234035","1200936","827756","602528","1319416","896606","1442662","517505","728186","456039","1075994","647087","1217862","877821","1065968","1580223","989874","570817","1266843","638189","670404","1167385","1534554","1150848","966572","1357504","1075424","1505728","1602800"],"submission_ids":["250435","240518","217401","292566","300314","308018","167562","268206","194514","231227","163615","165163","284064","163095","34921","277038","33451","227266","175897","166577","156768","289879","165310","230478","248233","275744","179352","280271","246990","286562","33008","142275","142274","171542"],"web_cover_ids":["2449","2449"],"type":"Song","added_by":"3","managed_by":"2"}
