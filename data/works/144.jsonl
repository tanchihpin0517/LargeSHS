In the late 1930s, with another global war looming on the horizon, Berlin returned to \"God Bless America\" and updated his lyrics to address the current state of the world. Nationally famous singer and radio personality Kate Smith premiered the song on her radio show on Armistice Day, November 11, 1938. The song was an instant hit and sales of the sheet music and recordings of the performance soared, prompting Berlin to found the 'God Bless America Foundation'. Through that organization, all proceeds from \"God Bless America\" went to the 'Boy and Girl Scouts of America'.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["77352","678179","278720","862325","532048","585313","605722","555866","1481058","1242080","1315968","1346347","1277240","171062","346844","538181","104945","625726","109593","1280898","488953","1223449","827608","1540612","1540640","1396811","1506671","77353","460529","445397","267874","862220","850161","673463","1192049","890507","563743","1384875","999112","565868","607466","607852","958026","777916","1041718","463480","411816","875271","475732","734628","817093","887997","1590436","1273421","1064749","1092747","1104662","1474157","745589","1540568","1082589","942006","187924","1155858","1295903","616849","710446","611492","1025169","1194590","197896","261775","752985","571010","1118393","1073379","575657","1301895","1283245"],"submission_ids":[],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"2","managed_by":null}

John Lomax visited the Angola Louisiana State Penitentiary in 1933 and recorded Huddie \"Lead Belly\" Ledbetter singing several takes of the song he knew as \"Irene\".  The song's lyrics tell of the singer's troubled past with his love, Irene, and express his sadness and frustration. Leadbelly and John Lomax regsitered the song as their own work, however several sources indicate Leadbelly adapted the song from one he learned from a family member. One possible source for this song was \"Irene, Good Night\" copyrighted by Gussie Lord Davis in 1892, which, in turn, was based on an earlier song.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["7842","240932","25165","40952","458829","131725","382491","458817","417949","524355","629140","236087","94303","93146","639542","1434292","131736","127916","938707","974191","782185","86627","92585","292812","362274","519097","16721","904452","874017","54765","289032","921986","292805","1278223","761516","131754","267089","35583","63396","92586","1566755","441060","1373665","710488","92587","294881","115498","397751","1143534","369731","253277","275576","277835","1396862","1415891","7843","426480","299737","304043","131752","622987","1497940","478810","1079094","1501144","361117","131751","673200","186352","971538","300994","574058","618878","103745","285274","131753","501378","22119","868762","1337498","491542","168665","911355","131743","905263","186353","624807","1349758","547384","1257126","603403","407745","1321102","1040126","537816","1080100","501098","348303","42433","155446","574429","947859","76107","85065","1198775","131803","1064154","912319","28557","676536","392741","48078","102592","527690","500291","1033373","29706","520436","60342","954406","59032","902475","45687","1213947","365739","18125","48106","591232","105592","1069436","620464","999676","21380","464672","535161","60145","1105543","531569","1096914","86884","577604","635891","1151217","1510255","1069121","1225384","173942","631548","981254","1184294","773273","1203454","395415","262812","394440","1098863","1491955","516376","388505","399375","401471","1526145","936492","1340083","818748","1052626","503956","783581","963510","604653","1179201","938211","1479415","1583767","1479457","1219845","1479455","354362","1202155","219854","953460","158149","1350883","47017","1555448","598351","671333","1328009","601685","169057","305726","306255","1376720","1218421","357944","1239556","1045641","1288581","1256971","1559445","1069610","487104"],"submission_ids":["93835","294178","180775","181288","308041","36022","161605","280233","257353","29901"],"web_cover_ids":["18068"],"type":"Song","added_by":"2","managed_by":null}
