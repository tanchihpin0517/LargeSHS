This instrumental was part of the opening credits and was used throughout as background music. The movie also has vocal versions by Louis Armstrong and (briefly) Dick Powell . The song was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1938. Helen Ward 's dark brown eyes were said to have been the inspiration for Johnny Mercer's lyrics.

This song was a worldwide hit for Manfred Mann twice - first in early 1968 with his self-named band of the time and ten years later with the Earth Band. It has not been confirmed, yet, how Mann became aware of the song. Dylan's first release of the song in his own name can be found on Self Portrait , a recording from his 1970 performance at the Isle of Wight festival. The first two known recordings of the song date to July 1967, made during Bob Dylan and The Band's \"Basement Tapes\" Woodstock sessions. Take 1 was released in 2014 on \"The Basement Tapes Complete - The Bootleg Series Vol. 11\" and the second take on the \"Biograph\" compilation in 1986.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["561426","33414","1540996","379360","892266","409032","367913","96248","51316","300103","825185","797285","1590630","758304","367534","1476745","134364","71957","27509","396721","923002","8360","8359","482951","1344629","958300","305919","530974","73677","1532091","829094","609606","1256356","597503","650344","733332","163284","556920","1028799","321144","464199","858155","322560","35667","107672","365289","1017834","309046","1197740","113863","173815","312013","855161","373070","155006","510674","533400","169913","196740","1149969","188841","475863","305856","508137","507147","965322","514431","592328","1156872","896544","1203941","1477411","1586489","1545624","1344230","16064","161335","231778","231799","427851","392332","936438","730470","504727","496028","200563","592074","883197","1457813"],"submission_ids":["289265","61025","293087","208986","283810","248913","242178","61026","207347"],"web_cover_ids":["13526","13526"],"type":"Song","added_by":"2","managed_by":null}

It was his first record and became a million seller.  Thereafter, it was shortened to \"Kansas City Blues\" (or \"Gonna Move to Kansas City\"). The song's melody line was re-used and developed by Charlie Patton (\"Going to Move to Alabama\") and Hank Williams (\"Move It On Over\") before emerging in \"Rock Around the Clock\", and its lyrical  content influenced Leiber and Stoller's \"Kansas City\". The song contains the line \"It takes a rocking chair to rock, a rubber ball to roll\", which had previously been used in 1924 by Ma Rainey in \"Jealous Hearted Blues\", and which Bill Haley would later incorporate into his 1952 recording, \"Sundown Boogie.\" Janis Joplin later recorded a song also titled \"Kansas City Blues\". Her lyrics included \"Goin' to Kansas City to bring Jim Jackson home\". Lyrics - I woke up this morning feelin\u2019 bad; Thought about the good times I once have had. I\u2019m gonna move to Kansas City; I\u2019m gonna move to Kansas City; I\u2019m gonna move, baby, honey where they don\u2019t \u2018low you. My mother told me, Daddy told me too, Everybody grins in your face son ain\u2019t no friend to you. You oughta move to Kansas City; you oughta move to Kansas City; You oughta move to Kansas City, baby, honey where they don\u2019t \u2018low you. I\u2019ve got me a bulldog, shepherd and two greyhounds; Two high yellas, three blacks and one brown. We gonna move to Kansas City; we gonna move to Kansas City; We gonna move, baby, honey where they don\u2019t \u2018low you; It takes a rockin\u2019 chair to rock, a rubber ball to roll; Nice lookin\u2019 teasin\u2019 brown to satisfy my soul. Then I\u2019ll move to Kansas City; then I\u2019ll move to Kansas City; I\u2019m gonna move to Kansas City, baby, honey where they don\u2019t \u2018low you. T is for Texas, T\u2019s for Tennessee; Boll weevil\u2019s got the Mississippi, and the women wants me. I\u2019m gonna move to Kansas City; I\u2019m gonna move to Kansas City; I\u2019m gonna move, baby, honey where they don\u2019t \u2018low you. You can always tell when your good girl wanta flirt; Wanta pair red slippers to match that old matchin\u2019 skirt.

Satie completed the whole set as a manuscript by April 2, 1888, but after this the 3 parts were published individually: the third in November 1888, the first and the second in 1895. The first publication of 1\u00e8re Gymnop\u00e9die in 1895 included a dedication to Mademoiselle Jeanne de Bret. This dedication was not present on the original manuscript from April 1888. The three short, atmospheric pieces are written in 3\/4 time, with each sharing a common theme and structure. 1re Gymnop\u00e9die Lent et douloureux (D major \/ D minor) 2e Gymnop\u00e9die Lent et triste (C major) 3e Gymnop\u00e9die Lent et grave (A minor) By the end of 1896, Satie's popularity was waning and financial situation deteriorating. Claude Debussy a friend of Satie's whose popularity was on the rise, helped draw public attention to Satie's work. In February 1897, Debussy orchestrated the third and first Gymnop\u00e9dies. When Debussy published the scores two years later, he reversed the numbering, with Satie's first becoming Debussy's third, and vice versa.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["757277","188488","1223758","1057879","1549211","1566919","191722","1414457","188487","642317","1017398","957999","985069","146669","1520920","1155697","907099","1552487","216969","957678","774852","1072864","142380","329455","1300119","958406","387892","1548788","474985","1424213","41807","957740","521554","985022","18521","8565","921019","1186943","904960","216867","1115776","650674","957937","666702","1269841","336693","258309","288220","1514686","929791","873305","245558","797610","785705","811896","458224","663542","1025189","437999","1050282","943719","338515","300578","529774","772505","958176","994459","878457","1578576","1183038","1336115","1071656","1394506","1377520","1177025","1447334","1394476","1546080","1524235","1535152"],"submission_ids":["278069","213582","237770","311816","263730","312649","188669","267243","189964","287779","293672","293658","263164"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Classical work","added_by":"3","managed_by":null}

First published in a Colonial Songster by A.T. Hodgson. \"The Wild Colonial Boy\" is a folk song telling the tale of Jack Dolan (or Jack Duggan, depending on the version), a notorious Australian outlaw. Believed to be based on real life Australian bush ranger Jack Donahue. Jack, the beloved only son of his parents, leaves his home at sixteen to become a bushranger. He roams the Australian bush, robbing wealthy squatters and destroying their stock while earning a reputation as a fearsome outlaw. His criminal career begins in 1861, and he gains notoriety for his daring exploits, including robbing a judge named MacEvoy. Despite his criminal actions, Jack is depicted as having a moral code, never robbing the poor or those who act fairly. The story reaches its climax when three mounted troopers\u2014Kelly, Davis, and Fitzroy\u2014track him down. Jack refuses to surrender and engages in a gunfight, ultimately being mortally wounded by Trooper Davis. The song portrays Jack as a heroic and rebellious figure, whose downfall is inevitable but who remains defiant to the end.
