Carl Rafferty's \"Mr. Carl's Blues,\" from 1933, introduced the familiar lyrics: \"I'm going to call up to China, just to see if my babe's over there\" and \"I do believe, I believe I'll dust my broom.\" Other notable pre-war versions were recorded by Josh White , Leroy Carr , and Kokomo Arnold , a slide guitarist. His \"Sagefield Woman Blues\" echoed the \"I believe, I believe I'll dust my broom\" line from the Rafferty record. On another recording, \"Sissy Man Blues,\" Arnold revived the China reference. Finally, Robert Johnson also added two new verses of his own.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":"I Believe I'll Make a Change written by Milton \"Lindberg\" Sparks","adapted_from_id":"281766","performance_ids":["9788","88051","83834","89593","103002","89594","89597","89601","89602","89592","85431","89636","83969","89627","89634","91122","100695","83825","217030","394971","90753","1309627","409455","90812","88633","86218","86530","100307","32159","570651","21873","1274265","34976","675290","502924","16527","101364","1115031","497939","224054","18335","97999","391276","134222","208390","1605144","595316","1069481","140103","1176331","806484","197500","1469471","1339272"],"submission_ids":["313910","117752"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"2","managed_by":null}
