There has been a vigorous debate about who actually wrote the song. Some say nobody can take credit for the composition because the authorship is unknown. The tune was around long before it had any commercial success, the argument goes, and is simply a folk song that\u2019s now in the public domain. Nevertheless, prominent songwriters on both sides of the US-Mexican border have claimed the song's copyrights. The most widely accepted credit is by Juan D\u00edaz del Moral, for the lyrics, and Emilio D. Uranga, for the music. The song was originally written for Mexico City\u2019s vibrant musical theater, according to Diaz del Moral\u2019s biography on the website of SACM, the Mexican composer\u2019s society. The pair reportedly registered the song in 1927, nine years before the film was released.","licensing":"Request a synchronization license","adapted_from":null,"adapted_from_id":null,"performance_ids":["326910","1524285","98878","447862","943244","262758","409283","1011602","572877","1472918","348523","1491024","1052641","1305175","1531401","512907","293036","1053857","1444219","1470009","485532","295570","1539605","1332667","1528384","1603642","1555684","240746","1484734","1484660","1403251","321236","1516995","129746","1529012","1060479","1324327","1504187","750864","1469924","1438386","834248","1470038","838533","510941","688479","688455","1524343","925663","741954","1604011","231397","1488997","1320159","844517","1265345","135259","1317324","1458742","265610","914297","627038","943916","918836","1296571","1604031","1108843","710723","1491069","1056018","514155","1514594","1507805","1603379","459937"],"submission_ids":["238069","266786","247944"],"web_cover_ids":[],"type":"Song","added_by":"9","managed_by":null}
